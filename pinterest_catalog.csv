gamla-goda-rugbraudstertan,Traditional rye bread cake – Gamla góða rúg­brauðstertan,"I love rúgbrauð, that heavy, sweet, moist Icelandic rye bread. It tastes so delicious - and you can also use it for other things, like a rye bread cake. Here on the blog, I've already tried and presented various typical Icelandic rye bread cakes - today I have another recipe for you. I found this recipe online, in an old article in the magazine Morgunblaðið from December 1967. For the cake, apart from the Rúgbrauð, you mainly need eggs, sugar, some flour and a bit of potato flour, and the filling consists of cream, bananas, apples and grated chocolate. Since I didn't want to bake Icelandic rye bread specifically for the cake in Germany, I used pumpernickel for the recipe and I think the result is really good!

This Nordic almond cake, also known in Norway as ""suksessterte"" (= ""success cake""), is a sweet cake that traditionally consists of two cake layers made of almond flour or ground almonds and a yellow cream based on cream and egg. The top of the cake is often decorated with chocolate, cocoa, almond flakes, etc.

There was a yellow weather warning, with winds of up to 15 m/s warning of sleet, snowfall and slush. The Icelandic Weather Service warns that poor visibility, blizzards and slush must be expected, particularly on mountain roads such as Hellisheiði. Maybe a warm berry soup is just the thing! If you like, you can serve the berry soup with a dollop of cream or fragrant rusks. PS: Instead of white wine, as stated in the recipe, I used white grape juice for our berry soup, it also tasted very good.

Since salmon is part of Easter for me, I contributed a salmon salad with cream cheese to our brunch, a laxasalat með rjómaosti . I think the salad tasted very good, nice and fresh and crunchy. A friend took the rest of the salad with her because she also found it so delicious, which made me very happy. So today I rushed to post the recipe for the salmon salad here on the blog.

In Iceland, you can traditionally find such hearty bread cakes with mayonnaise, lots of mayonnaise and even more mayonnaise between sweet pastries at many buffets, from celebrations with friends and family gatherings to funerals and company events. The white bread for the typical Icelandic Brauðterta is bought frozen in 650 g packs from the supermarket, left to thaw in the fridge overnight and then prepared the cake the next day. It is similar to bread for toasting, but sliced horizontally instead of vertically.

sitronu-bollakokur,Lemon cupcakes – Sítrónu bollakökur,"In Icelandic, muffins are usually referred to as ""múffur"". However, there is also the word ""bollakaka"", meaning ""cup cake"", in English ""cupcake"" - a small cake the size of a cup. After baking, such a “mug cake” is decorated with an icing or an opulent cream topping. In contrast to classic muffins, cupcakes are also made from batter, but they usually do not contain any nuts or spices and the icing or topping is complex. Spring is coming - and I felt like it was fresh, fruity and colorful! This turned into these lemon muffins, with a little yellow food coloring for a more colorful glaze. Of course, you can also leave out the food coloring - or go wild and make really colorful muffins, just as you like!

Icelanders like to eat pancakes with coffee, but they are also perfect for a leisurely, late breakfast - especially with cream and fresh fruit.

I had previously bought a mini springform pan with a diameter of 5 inches (12 cm). The result...? Small, tasty and really makes a nice visual impression!

salat-med-jardarberjum-og-fraejum,Salad with strawberries and seeds – Salat með jarðarberjum og fræjum,"Friday is Valentine's Day (February 14th). And for many, strawberries are very romantic fruits. The intense color red alone makes you want more. Strawberries are also considered “natural aphrodisiacs” because of their high vitamin C and zinc content. I don't know whether this can be measurably proven, but strawberries are definitely healthy, support the immune system and protect against cardiovascular diseases with their secondary plant substances and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Although they taste so sweet, strawberries are very low in fructose and calories (around 33 kcal per 100 g) and contain more vitamin C than oranges or lemons. Just around 200 g of strawberries cover an adult's average daily vitamin C requirement. Plus, strawberries taste and smell so good!

The winter month of Þorri #, the ""drought month"", begins on Friday between January 18th and 24th, i.e. on January 24th in this year 2025. On the first day of this month, the traditional feast Þorrablót was celebrated, which also paid special tribute to the master of the house. From this tradition came the bóndadagur, i.e. the “day of the landlord”. Today bóndadagur has become “Husbands Day”; you give your husband flowers, treat him to delicious food or in other ways. As a surprise for my husband today, I have this delicious chocolate skyr with dark chocolate and fresh orange. And afterwards we have a barbecue with the family present...

And since there are no nuts in the dough, colleagues who have a nut allergy and can never eat gingerbread were also able to eat, because there are nuts in everything. Actually, a cream cheese glaze was supposed to be used, but since I had to transport the cake in the car and couldn't keep it cool all the time, I preferred to make a simple powdered sugar glaze, which also goes very well with gingerbread!

rjupa-og-sosa,Ptarmigan and sauce – Rjúpa og sósa,"A classic Icelandic Christmas food is ptarmigan (rjúpa). However, the animal population in Iceland is declining drastically, which is why ptarmigan hunting has been increasingly restricted, for example hunting is only allowed on certain days of the year and the number of animals per hunter is also limited. Hunting is only permitted for personal use; selling is prohibited. However, you can now find ptarmigan from Great Britain frozen in Icelandic supermarkets - either breasts or whole birds. On average, a bird weighs just around 400 g.   Classic side dishes for the ptarmigan here with the sauce are potatoes, peas and cold red cabbage, but fresh salad, for example, also tastes good with it.

You can also easily make them yourself without much effort. I already have recipes for fish cakes here on the blog, for example very classic fried fish cakes, a long-time favorite from November 2017, for fish cakes with spinach from June 2016 or for spicy fish cakes with coriander and chili from June 2019.   I recently came across this recipe for fish cakes in an old Icelandic cooking magazine - the fish cakes are served in a beautifully spicy tomato and crab sauce.

graenkalspesto,Kale pesto – Grænkálspestó,"In other countries, kale is a typical winter vegetable. It is often said that kale should only be harvested after the first frost. Kale doesn't actually need frost to convert starch into sugar; generally low temperatures are enough. Ripe kale contains hardly any starch that could be converted, but continues to produce glucose through photosynthesis. And “generally low temperatures” are not a problem in Iceland, where the low temperatures often exist all summer long.  Here in Iceland, kale grows outdoors and thrives particularly well. The harvest time is usually from July to December and the kale can then be bought fresh in the supermarket. Since there are not that many vegetables here that can grow without geothermal energy, kale is used in a variety of ways in Icelandic cuisine, for example fresh in salads, smoothies or juices, cooked in soups, fried as a side dish or casseroles. There are also kale chips - and they are also very suitable for fresh pesto. Kale is also good for a healthy diet - like most types of cabbage, it is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber and protein. It even ranks first among cabbage varieties in terms of its content of vitamins B, E and K, calcium, folic acid and iron. It also contains a number of phytochemicals that regulate cholesterol and blood sugar levels and strengthen the immune system.

""Ljótur að utan, ljúfur að innan"" - ""ugly on the outside, lovely on the inside"" is the motto of this blue cheese, which has been produced for several years by the Icelandic dairy MS in Búðardalur in western Iceland. The cheese is not particularly crumbly and it looks impressively ugly from the outside, but tastes wonderful to us!

Icelanders often love sweet cream cakes, so I was very happy when I discovered a recipe for sugar-free cream cake on an Icelandic website. As a sugar substitute I used sprinkled sweetener (strásæta), which I bought here at Bónus, but as far as I know you can also find it in other shops, such as Hagkaup. The sprinkled sweetener consists of erythritol, has around 70% of the sweetness of table sugar and can in principle be used like sugar when baking. Erythritol is odorless, heat-stable and does not bind moisture from the environment, meaning unlike sugar, it does not clump. When dissolved in liquids, it has a cooling effect. It is almost calorie-free (0.2 kcal per 100 g) and, according to studies from the 1990s, has no effect on blood sugar or insulin levels. Additionally, it cannot be metabolized by oral bacteria and therefore does not cause tooth decay. However, it is recommended that a healthy adult should not consume more than 35 g of erythritol per day on average to avoid a laxative effect and, if possible, no increased risk of heart disease and blood clots.

They initially lived in Denmark with their children for a long time, but for several years now they have been living in Iceland, near their Icelandic mother-in-law. On her food tour, Sabrina told us, among other things, about the typical Icelandic Christmas meal and about a special specialty of her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law always uses the liquid from the can of peas for the white sauce. “It sounds nasty, but it tastes incredibly delicious”, was Sabrina’s conclusion.   Of course I had to try it - I love Christmas, I love Christmas food, I love Icelandic food. So absolutely perfect for me! And after test-eating, I can only agree with Sabrina's conclusion - sounds nasty, but tastes incredibly delicious! The canned pea liquid gives the roux a wonderfully velvety taste! By the way, did you know that statistically every Icelander eats two cans of canned peas at Christmas? With around 380,000 Icelanders, around 760,000 cans of these peas are sold here every Christmas!

haustsupa,Autumn soup with minced meat – Haustsúpa,"It is now really autumn. The sheep roundups are over, the animals are back in the pastures on the farms or on the way to the butcher. The supplies for the winter are being prepared. The Icelandic cuisine in autumn is in accordance with this - for example, a typical Icelandic autumn soup consists of minced meat, with or without bacon, chopped tomatoes, broth and lots of vegetables and potatoes. I brought you a recipe for such an autumn soup ( haustsúpa ) today. The soup is then served with a dollop of sour cream and herbs.

bananabraud,Banana bread – Bananabrauð,"Recently a friend of mine had a question: She had bought a delicious banana bread in a shop in Flúðir, less bread, actually more of a cake, similar to marble or lemon cake, but with banana flavor. She wanted to bake something like this herself, but was still looking for a recipe. The recipes she had found on my blog were too much in the direction of bread and not enough in the direction of cake... So at the weekend I tried another recipe and baked it together with my grandchild - and the result was this very tasty, very fluffy banana bread, actually much more cake than bread. I was very happy with the result, but both my grandchild and my youngest offspring were completely thrilled and both tucked in extensively. There was only a tiny piece left.

sarah-bernhardt-i-ofnskuffu,Sörur from the baking tray – Sarah Bernhardt í ofnskúffu,"This weekend was my husband's birthday and we celebrated with family and friends. I baked a lot for the coffee table, including trying out a new recipe for ""Sörur from the baking tray"" - and I'm thrilled. This sweet with almond base, butter cream and chocolate is actually the invention of a Danish confectioner who developed it in 1911 on the occasion of Sarah Bernhardt (1844 - 1923)'s visit to Copenhaben. In Danish the sweet particles are called ""Sarah Bernhardt Kager"", in Sweden they are called ""biskvier"" and in Iceland it has become very popular as ""Sara"", in the plural then ""Sörur"", especially - but not only - at Christmas time . Normally Sörur is prepared as small, round, high-domed cakes and it is relatively time-consuming. Alternatively, I'm really excited about this tray version: the taste is just right - and baked in a tray and cut into cubes, it's also much easier to prepare, takes up a lot more space to store and is also great to eat in small portions!   Sörur - in a classic shape vs. cubes from baking tray

blomkalssalat-med-dodlum-og-bonunum,Cauliflower salad with dates and bananas – Blómkálssalat með döðlum og bönunum,"Here in Iceland, I usually love having chopped dates on my pizza - so I was thrilled when I came across this recipe for cauliflower salad with dates. And had to try it straight away! However, I recommend mixing the salad and sauce just before serving and not letting the salad sit for too long, otherwise it might get a little mushy. By the way, a head of cauliflower weighs on average around 800 g - the cauliflower I got here in the store was quite small, only a handful at a time, and weighed around 500 g with everything. So I used two small heads.

kurbitssupa,Zucchini soup – Kúrbítssúpa,"While shopping at Litla Bændabúðin recently in Flúðir, I ""inherited"" a zucchini from a friend who bought a three-pack of fresh zucchinis, which I then spontaneously made into a very tasty soup at home. Zucchini are a subspecies of garden squash that belong to the cucurbit family. It is a breed that was originally bred by indigenous peoples in Central America and then came to Europe with seafarers in the 16th and 17th centuries. Today zucchinis also grow in Icelandic greenhouses. The English name ""zucchini"" comes from Italian, where this fruit is called ""zucchino"", a diminutive of ""zucca"" (= ""pumpkin""). In Icelandic, the zucchini is called ""kúrbítur"".

skuffukaka-i-heila-ofnskuffu,Icelandic chocolate cake from a tray – Skúffukaka í heila ofnskúffu,"""Skúffa"" is the Icelandic word for ""drawer"" or ""baking tray"" (= ""oven drawer""), and accordingly ""skúffukaka"" is a cake that is traditionally baked as a sheet cake. The classic Icelandic sheet cake, the ""skúffukaka"", is a chocolate cake with a thick layer of buttercream or powdered sugar icing, often with grated coconut on top or a bit of licorice. There are an incredible number of recipes for Skúffukaka, and I have already posted various variations here on the blog. Normally I bake smaller recipes, for a 10 x 14 inches (25 x 35 cm) baking tin or something similar, this time we had visitors who I wanted to present to ""classic Icelandic cake"", and in addition to carrot cake, there were cinnamon rolls and a ""strawberry bomb"". with meringue, just a complete sheet of skúffukaka.

jardarberjasprengja,Strawberry bomb – Jarðarberjasprengja,"This was actually a recipe for a rhubarb bomb, but as is the case in Icelandic supermarkets outside Reykjavík - it's often a matter of luck what I get, especially with fruit and vegetables. I even often have problems getting cucumbers - it's even more difficult with fruit... Long story short: there was no rhubarb in the supermarket, neither fresh nor frozen. So the planned rhubarb bomb quickly became a strawberry bomb. Also very tasty! I find this sweet mixture of whipped cream, meringue and fruit very typically Icelandic.

uppahalds-gulrotarkakan-min,My current favorite carrot cake – Uppáhalds gulrótarkakan mín,"I have baked countless carrot cakes over the last 10 or 15 years, in many different variations and variants. The cake is my daughter's declared favorite cake; she has wanted it for her birthday for years, and of course I also baked a carrot cake for her confirmation, her wedding and the christening of her grandchild. Some of them were rather opulent cakes, some were quick, simple cakes baked in a classic loaf pan, some with cream cheese or cream, and some just with icing.   Over the years my recipes have changed, and the last few times I baked carrot cake with peaches in it, along with chopped hazelnuts and almonds. At the moment, this is my current favorite version of an Icelandic carrot cake. Recently a friend of mine, who I wanted to bake a cake for, asked me if she would like the carrot cake..? Yes, of course, of course! And when we had visitors over the next few days, I baked carrot cake again and the visitors raved that it was, without a lie, the best carrot cake they had ever eaten... Well, that makes you feel...!

sykurlaus-kryddkaka,Sugar-free spice cake – Sykurlaus kryddkaka,"Last weekend we had a dear friend visit who is currently trying to eat as little refined sugar/table sugar as possible. So I tried to bake something suitable to go with it... The original recipe called for 150 g of raw sugar, but I found sweetener/sprinkling sweetener in the supermarket, a can with 75 g, which according to the label on the package was 5 times sweeter than sugar. I then simply tried it out and mixed a few tablespoons of it with the margarine and the eggs and then tested whether the taste was there. I compensated for the lack of volume in the dough (and a bit of sweetness) with the grated carrots and the chopped dates. The result is definitely a very tasty, fluffy spice cake!

hversgads-eplakaka,Everyday apple pie – Hversgads eplakaka,"This week I spontaneously baked an apple cake, a very simple recipe - with lots of sugar cinnamon on the cake. After all, cinnamon is supposed to be healthy - cinnamon is said to have many health-promoting properties, for example cinnamon is said to stimulate the appetite, promote intestinal activity and metabolism, and cinnamon is often said to have an antibacterial and even labor-promoting effect. Cinnamon is also said to improve insulin sensitivity, help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol (LDL). However, much of it is not scientifically proven, or only partially. Or what did I hear on the radio the other day? Whether cinnamon has long-term health benefits or not, ""Apple cake with cinnamon definitely tastes better than cinnamon without apple cake.""

spinatsalat-med-jardarberjum,Spinach salad with strawberries – Spínatsalat með jarðarberjum,"The cultivation of strawberries in Iceland does not have a long history - reports of the first attempts to grow strawberries on the island date back to the end of the 19th century. And the attempts were initially not particularly successful; the Icelandic climate is not necessarily ideal for growing strawberries outdoors. In 1896, the first greenhouse was built in Iceland, where flowers and vegetables were first grown. From around 1920, some strawberries were also grown in greenhouses, from the 1930s onwards cultivation became increasingly successful and today strawberries in Iceland grow all year round in large, geothermally heated and illuminated greenhouses. You can generally buy fresh Icelandic strawberries in local shops from early summer to late autumn. Strawberries ( jarðarber ) have now become an integral part of Icelandic cuisine, from jams to desserts and sweet cakes to savory dishes, sauces and salads - like this recipe for spinach salad with fresh strawberries, cheese and nuts.

kaldur-braudrettur-med-raekjum-og-ananas,Cold bread dish with crabs and pineapple – Kaldur brauðréttur með rækjum og ananas,"Bread dishes are very popular among Icelanders these days. The first recorded recipe for a bread dish was published in Morgunblaðið at the beginning of 1974, as a delicious meal for parties after a visit to the cinema or theater that can also be easily prepared. The recipe back then involved cutting open baguettes, hollowing them out, spreading them with butter and mustard and then topping them with salami, onions, tomatoes and olives. The baguettes were then topped with cheese and simply put in the oven before eating. Since the beginning of the 80s, bread dishes have been very popular in Iceland as party food, either warm or cold, gratinated with cheese or not. Such bread dishes are also included on the cake buffet; many Icelanders love sweet cakes as well as hearty snacks. Here I have a recipe for a cold bread dish for you, fresh, fruity - and at least with cheese cubes, if not gratinated with cheese!

Such a cake is called ""Hnallþóra"" in Icelandic, after a character in the novel by Halldór Laxness. These cakes come in many different versions, e.g. with bananas, chocolate cream, berries and coconut flakes, chocolate meringue with cream and chocolate icing, or with fluffy dough with lots of cream, rose water and fruit liqueur... Definitely with lots of cream, lots of sugar, if in doubt also with lots of syrup and lots Fruit. More is more!

In addition to apple juice, some lemon juice is also added to the ice cream mixture. To emphasize the fresh lemon aroma a little more, I added a few lemon verbena leaves. Of course the plant is not in any way typically Icelandic, I simply met it at the nursery that day and spontaneously fell in love with the smell. It actually hardly smells at all, but if you rub a leaf a little... it really packs a punch! I love the smell! So a little bit of it was allowed into the ice cream. But of course it works without it!

skyrkokur-med-jardarberjum,Skyr dessert with strawberries – Skyrkökur með jarðarberjum,"Villijarðarber, or wild strawberries, grow in Iceland. In Iceland, wild strawberries are found throughout the country, but especially in the lowlands. The wild strawberries that grow in the wild are much smaller and much less sweet than the strawberry varieties grown for sale. Strawberries for sale in Iceland grow in geothermally heated greenhouses .    Strawberries of the “ Sonata ” variety are often grown here - these berries have very evenly shaped, relatively large fruits with a sweet, fruity taste. Thanks to their firmness, the strawberries can be stored well and are wonderful for preserving or for jam or jelly - or, as here, as strawberry puree for dessert.   Personally, I like to decorate strawberry desserts with chopped pistachios - on the one hand because of the color effect, which is reminiscent of fresh strawberries with green on them, and on the other hand because of the feel. I love the difference between the sweet, soft strawberry cream and the crunchy pistachios!

In the original recipe, 150 ml of cognac is added to the ice cream mixture and in my old cookbook from the second-hand shop there is a handwritten note ""children love summer"". Much to my husband's dismay, I skipped the cognac, even though the alcohol is probably good for the creaminess of the ice cream.

You can also serve the soup in small portions as a dessert - the dish is actually quite filling. Classic recipes like this recipe here on the blog from 2016 use Icelandic rye bread (rúgbrauð), malt beer and grated lemon peel, and often a little lemon juice too. Here I modified it a bit and used Malt og Appelsín . According to the manufacturer's description, Egil's mixture of malt beer and Appelsín (= very sweet, very colorful orange lemonade) is the ""Icelandic national drink since 1955"". The mixture is usually available at Christmas as ""jólaöl"" (= non-alcoholic Christmas beer), but also at Easter as ""páskaöl"" - and ready in cans all year round as ""Malt og Appelsín"". After being offered it by a friend, ""Malt og Appelsín"" was also the current favorite drink of two of my older children when they visited us in Iceland before Easter. Outside of Iceland, I recommend replacing the Rúgbrauð with pumpernickels and Malt & Appelsín with 200 ml malt beer and 130 ml orange lemonade.

sweet-recipes-for-easter,Sweet recipes for Easter,"I'm thinking about what I could maybe bake for Easter and I'm digging through my notebook for old recipes... I just realized that my blog will be 10 years old in July, 10 years since I collected and tried out Icelandic cooking and baking recipes and shared and posted them here... I think I'm getting sentimental.. . So it’s better to quickly get back to meal planning for Easter! By the way, the very first recipe I posted here was Gulrótarkaka, Icelandic carrot cake, my daughter's declared favorite cake. I think we were able to lure her to Iceland for the first time with the prospect of carrot cake at Café Loki. So carrot cake is always an option when I'm thinking about what cake to bake for a special occasion.   A few years ago, especially for Easter, I baked this Páskakaka (= Easter cake), a sponge cake with two layers and yellow and orange butter-sugar-chocolate cream, because yellow is the typical color for Easter here in Iceland. I decorated the cake with Easter eggs and bunnies, even though you rarely get small eggs in Iceland and especially not small Easter bunnies. Icelandic Easter sweets are big, literally.   I baked this Appelsínukaka (= orange cake) here for Easter two years ago, for a cozy coffee hour - thanks to the good weather, even on the terrace. A nice, quick recipe for a fruity sponge cake that can be prepared quickly even at short notice. Even my youngest, who isn't really a big cake fan, wanted a second helping of the cake...   8 years ago, when my mother was still alive and my sister was able to visit at Easter, I made a small peppermint ice cream cake with Oreo cookies and licorice as a dessert for the big family feast on Easter Sunday. It was also delicious, but I haven't made it in a long time...   This Húsfreyjuterta, the ""housewife's cake"", is also a very tasty but somewhat complex dessert cake. To be honest, I have no idea how the cake got its name, but I definitely like it and it looks good too, with the cream filling and the caramel icing. And you can have fun with the decoration on the cake if you like.   Or I'll just make the raspberry licorice cake that I baked recently...? With the mixture of fruit, chocolate and licorice, I found the cake wonderfully refreshing, fruity and really interesting with the licorice balls!   A classic option is of course Kransakaka. Such a ""wreath cake"" is a special specialty for festive occasions in many parts of Scandinavia and here in Iceland you can often find it on the cake buffet, especially at baptisms and confirmations. A cake like this actually has 15 to 18 stacked cake rings. The cake consists of a lot of marzipan and sugar and is really delicious, but I don't like eating large portions of it in one go. That's why I only limited myself to 6 wreaths when baking - we're not such a big company and, to be honest, marzipan is pretty expensive here in Iceland...   Very important for an Icelandic Easter are of course these huge chocolate Easter eggs, filled with sweets and a note with a good wish or advice - either homemade Easter eggs ...   ... or one of the many eggs in different sizes that you can buy everywhere in the supermarket. A huge Easter egg like these two, which a dear friend gave to our youngest and our grandchild, weighs an impressive 520 g!   Well, I still have two or three days until I have to decide what I want to bake for Easter this year... Happy Easter, happy birthday!  [Translated from here.]

lakkristerta-med-hindberjum,Liquorice cake with raspberries – Lakkrísterta með hindberjum,"The recipe here is for a small but rich raspberry licorice cake. Wonderfully fruity, wonderfully chocolaty and with a distinct licorice taste! Yes, I know, not everyone loves licorice, even in our family - but those who do like licorice found this cake very tasty!   By the way, I have my husband to thank for the bag with the licorice balls:   On one of the last flights to Iceland something went wrong on the way to Germany, the plane had technical problems or a suspected defect, but in any case it only left Keflavík with a long delay. However, there were meal vouchers for the waiting time at the airport, and because despite a generous breakfast and delicious pizza for lunch there was still plenty of voucher left, my husband then used the rest for Opal schnapps and chocolate licorice. I then used one of the bags of licorice balls (130 g) for this cake: about 30 g went into the melted chocolate cream, I then cut about 12 balls in half and used them for decoration. There were still a few balls left over to snack on...

Combined with small tomatoes, orange, mozzarella and basil, roasted nuts - and dates and blueberries to sweeten it. But tomatoes grow in greenhouses in Iceland, blueberries are also plentiful, at least in late summer, and dates can be found in many Icelandic recipes. I find this mix of classic and modern very interesting - and we really enjoyed this fruity salad!

It should be enough for a lot of people and I also wanted to take some cake with me to work for my colleagues. So instead of a round springform pan (approx. 24 cm) I used a baking tray (approx. 25 cm x 35 cm) and twice the amount of dough (but the same baking time).

heitt-salt-karamellu-sukkuladi-i-nyjum-bolla,Hot salted caramel chocolate in a new cup – Heitt salt karamellu súkkulaði í nýjum bolla,"Do you know that feeling when you can finally fulfill a long-held dream? It doesn't necessarily have to be something big, sometimes even small things can make you very happy. There is this shop in Reykjavík on Skólavörðustígur, the shopping street that leads from Laugavegur up to Hallgrímskirkja. The whole shop window is full of beautiful cups. All of them hang on transparent threads in the window and turn gently in the breeze, always showing a new side of themselves. I don't know how many times I've stood in front of the shop window and admired these cups!   But my husband was of the opinion, admittedly not entirely wrongly, that I actually already had enough cups and no more space in the kitchen cupboards anyway. So I stopped myself from dreaming about the cup... wonderful, but over thirst, not necessary, that's true...   When I received my invoice from the publisher in January, I spontaneously decided - now I'm going to treat myself to one of these cups and make this dream come true.   And so I happily took my cup home with me!   The classic cups here in Inga Elín's gallery (with a blue or black pattern) cost 6,000 ISK, the equivalent of around €40. The (slightly smaller) espresso cup costs 5,000 ISK. However, the cups from the Gold collection, which I also find very beautiful, cost €12,000 and - unlike the other cups - they are not dishwasher or microwave safe. So I finally spontaneously decided on the “ Bylur ” model. The name means something like ""snowstorm"", but in fact it is defined in the dictionary as ""high winds with strong gusts and snowfall"". I inaugurated my new cup with a hot chocolate with salted caramel - just the thing when the snow is storming outside!

But you can also find restaurants in Iceland that offer these rich sandwiches as a speciality, such as Jómfrúin in Reykjavík, which now also has a restaurant at the airport in Keflavík. Buttered sandwiches used to be common when traveling and picking up food to eat along the way. The Danish ""Smörrebröd"" in the form we know today probably only developed around 1880 . The earliest known evidence of smörrebröd can be found on the menu of the elegant Copenhagen restaurant Nimb from 1883. The Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen (1805 - 1875) was the inspiration for this Snörrebröd - in his diaries, HC Andersen wrote down what he liked to eat most, and this special bread was then developed from these

Replace yogurt). The cake was really well received - the guest child was very surprised and asked if I had really baked the cake myself because it was ""absolutely delicious"". “It's really cool” was his comment when I confirmed to him - yes, the cake was actually homemade!

So it still feels like summer, warm and humid... However, a look at our terrace in Iceland quickly brings me to the realization that the summer of 2023 is already over - winter is approaching, and fast. There have been quite a few snowstorms in Iceland this week. The ring road over the Hellisheiði was temporarily closed and even after it opened there was a solid blanket of snow on the road and a lot of wind and gusts of wind. Our house is actually somewhat sheltered, so we haven't had a lot of snow yet, but it was stormy and windy too. The wind even opened a closed door. Our neighbors were there and everything seems to be fine again. Winter has only just begun...   We're going back to Iceland next week - and to get in the mood for the winter conditions, I baked a batch of snowman cookies. Chocolate cookies in the shape of a snowman - smákökur , or "" small cakes "", as they say in Icelandic. I think the cookies are delicious - and child 3 in particular is very enthusiastic about them. It's nice to hear such praise!

regnbogar,Rainbows – Regnbogar,"For me, Iceland is definitely the land of rainbows. In nature in Iceland I always see a rainbow somewhere - whether in the bright sunshine at the waterfall like here at Skógafoss...   ... or in the middle of the rain like here at Litla kaffistofa on the ring road on Hellisheiði.   And not only does nature constantly produce beautiful rainbows, most people in Iceland also fully support what the rainbow stands for politically/socially: as a symbol of the LGBTQ community.   Like here in the picture from Gleðiganga 2022, the Reykjavík Pride Parade - the whole street was rainbow colored, the spectators on the street, the street, the shops... A great experience!  Iceland is actually a good country to live in. Actually. Iceland has always been a pioneer in legislation for the full rights of queer people and social acceptance is higher in Iceland than in most other countries. But there are also regressions in Iceland; in recent years there has been increasing hostility and even attacks on people from the LGBTQ community. Most recently, at the end of September 2023, a participant at a Samtökin '78 conference was physically attacked on his way home in Reykjavík and had to spend a night in the hospital. The government has responded to the attacks by passing laws against hate speech. A campaign is currently in progress to provide information and awareness in this area. “Raising awareness cannot wait!” said Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s statement. So with that in mind - rainbows, especially now!   A little person recently had his 5th birthday here and asked for a birthday cake “with a rainbow and a mermaid”. Of course, grandma also developed ambition to be able to fulfill this birthday wish.   This rainbow birthday cake is of course not a typical Icelandic cake. But rainbows are typically Icelandic. If you also want to bake a cake like this, I have brought you a recipe anyway.   By the way, my little mermaid here is made from colored marzipan that I kneaded and shaped.

The answer was ""I love anything with vanilla and caramel"". So I went looking and in the one beautiful cookbook about everyday Icelandic cooking in a new look from 1992 that I recently found in the second-hand shop in Reykjavík, there was a recipe for baked Skyr cake in it. Originally, pure Skyr was intended, but given my declared love for vanilla, I used vanilla Skyr. And instead of the fruit sauce that was originally intended, I used the thick, sweet caramel sauce that I recently used for apple pie... The result was definitely one of the best skyr cakes I've baked so far - wonderfully creamy, fresh and also very fruity thanks to the lemon zest and juice. It was very well received and was really almost perfect for me too! I definitely need to bake this more often!

ofnbakadur-saltfiskur,Oven baked salt fish – Ofnbakaður saltfiskur,"One day I made saltfish casserole for dinner for us. Salt fish is an important part of Icelandic cuisine, as the aim is to preserve fresh fish for as long as possible - in earlier times it was vitally important for the people here in Iceland. Salt fish are so-called “hard-salted fish products” made from beheaded and gutted fish. Fish with a salt content of over 20% in the fish tissue water are called “hard salted”. Salting basically does not change the structure and color of the fish or fish fillet, nor does it change the basic taste - but it becomes very salty to very, very salty. It is therefore important to water the fish thoroughly before preparing it or, if necessary, to soak it in water overnight. Nowadays you can often buy “lightly salted” salt fish. Although it has a shorter shelf life than “real” salt fish, it is often sold frozen so that its shelf life is ensured. The ""lightly salted"" fish still tastes salty and no additional salt is necessary for the dish, but you can use the fish directly without having to spend any time watering it first. I also used lightly salted frozen fish for this fish casserole.

jardeplamjols-sandkaka,Sand cake with potato flour – Jarðeplamjöls-sandkaka,"We have successfully arrived back at our Iceland house. This time there were actually no incidents, so far everything has worked well, the water works, the toilet is tight, the hot pot is running. Perfect! A dear friend came over for a moment on Monday. We hadn't expected him until the afternoon, but he actually came at lunchtime - but I was lucky, I had taken the cake out of the oven five minutes before he came. The whole house was still filled with the smell of cake. That was really a precision landing! Our Icelandic friend was happy - such fresh cake, the smell... add a big glass of cold milk and the world is perfect! Well, our friend preferred to drink coffee, but raved about childhood memories with such freshly baked cakes and cold milk. And he was also happy to take a second piece. The fresh, still warm cake was also delicious!

rifsberjamarengs,Currant meringue – Rifsberjamarengs,"We baked at the weekend, the grandchild and I. The result is this cake with currant meringue. Almost everyone found it very tasty, even those who are not usually particularly fond of cake. Only the grandchild found the currants too sour and just ate cake base with cream. It is said that currants came to Iceland in the 18th century with Skúli Magnússon (1711 - 1794):   Skúli was born as a pastor's son in northern Iceland, studied in Denmark and returned to Iceland in 1734 as an administrative officer in the service of the Danish king. In 1749, Skúli became the first Icelander to become bailiff of Iceland, i.e. the country's highest administrator. He lived on the island of Viðey for many years and created a garden here with many plants that he had brought with him to Iceland from Denmark, including bush fruits such as currants. However, the red currants that are now mainly found in Iceland are traced back to a traditional old variety that was brought to Iceland from Norway at the end of the 19th century. The bushes grow well in many Icelandic gardens and are very productive with 6 to 8 kilograms of berries per bush per year.

I prepared twice the amount of cream and served the dessert in smaller glasses, which was enough for 6 people. I usually make the simple amount for two of us and use larger jars (350 ml).

gratineradur-karri-plokkfiskur,Baked curry plokkfiskur – Gratíneraður karrí plokkfiskur,"For me, this is one of the most typical Icelandic dishes ever - plokkfiskur, meaning ""pounded fish"". The Icelandic housewife used to bring fish and potatoes to the table several times a week, the ""staple food"" of Icelanders in the past, as both were relatively easily available and reasonably affordable. If there were any leftovers, they were reused - and the next day we had ""mashed fish"": simply chop up the cooked potatoes and the cooked fish, mix them and heat them with white sauce. I know you're unlikely to win a beauty prize with this food. And depending on how it's prepared, it can taste bland in the canteen if you're unlucky. But well seasoned and perhaps gratinated with cheese, then Plokkfiskur is really “soul food” for me. Here I have a version that is beautifully seasoned with cumin and curry, giving it a very special touch - really delicious, I think!

kanilfletta-cinnamon-plait,Kanilflétta - Cinnamon Plait,"I wanted to show you what I baked on Thursday for the first day of summer here in Iceland - a cinnamon plait! Cinnamon rolls always work, I think, and here in Iceland they almost fall under the category of “staple food”. This time I changed things up and baked a cinnamon plait out of the dough instead of cinnamon rolls. The basic recipe comes from my favorite cinnamon rolls, but I also used a little butter to brush it on to keep it a little moister, and after rolling up the dough I didn't cut the roll into slices, but lengthwise into two strands , which I then braided together and baked into a suitable cake tin. I'm definitely very happy with the result of my cinnamon roll cake! The cinnamon plait was also well received during the visit and child 4 also participated very enthusiastically.

uppahaldsidyfan-min,My (current) favorite dip – Uppáhaldsídýfan mín,"I made this dip for Easter this year, as a sort of “starter” for Easter dinner. The dip was served while we were playing “Carcassonne” with the family and simply placed on the table. Child 4, skeptical, initially only took one cracker, but then very carefully tried a little bit of the dip - and then enthusiastically loaded the cracker full. Our visit was also very enthusiastic - and the dip was immediately promoted to our current favorite dip. Ideal if you want to offer a little something! By the way, the grated cheese I used here was a 4-cheese blend of mozzarella, Gouda, Maribo cheese and a Tindur cheese that was aged for at least 12 months. You can't really tell which types they are, so it certainly works with other cheese mixtures too.

kransakaka,Wreath cake – Kransakaka,"Such a ""wreath cake"" is a special specialty for festive occasions in many parts of Scandinavia and here in Iceland you can often find it on the cake buffet, especially at baptisms and confirmations. A cake like this actually consists of 15 to 18 stacked cake rings. The cake consists of a lot of marzipan and sugar and is very tasty, but at least I can't eat a lot of it in one go! I have now only made 1/3 of the recipe and baked a small wreath cake with only 6 rings as a dessert for our Easter meal. Sort of like an “Easter edition” with a small Easter egg on the cake for decoration. However, the Easter eggs came from Germany - here in Iceland we don't know boiled colored chicken eggs or small chocolate Easter eggs. There are really large chocolate eggs (páskaegg) filled with chocolate and other sweets, and the smallest filled egg weighs at least 120 g, the ""giant eggs"" can weigh 1 kilo or more.

solskin,Sunshine – Sólskin,"This dish used to be a classic summer dish in Iceland - sorrel or fresh spinach in white sauce. Traditionally it is served with fish, either cooked fresh or salted fish, but it also goes well with smoked fish or fish balls. In winter, you use fresh kale for this “sunshine” dish to at least bring a little “sunshine” into your home from a culinary point of view. With the current winter in Iceland, where one winter storm follows the next, it is urgently needed if you ask me..!

These peppermint candies are often used in Icelandic cuisine, whether as a crunch on a milkshake or on a cake. Here I used cream chocolate with a piece of Bismark peppermint candies as a special touch in the buttercream for these chocolate muffins. However, we also snacked on a few pieces of chocolate, it was just too delicious and tasted really interesting in the best sense of the word!

The recipe here is for cream ice cream - with a little skyr and this typical Icelandic ""púðursykur"", which is not - as the name might sugest - powdered sugar, but simply brown sugar with a relatively high molasses content. We had this Christmas ice cream for New Year's Eve - the photo is from New Year's Day, when I photographed the ice cream outside in the deep snow in bright sunshine.

bessastadakokur,Bessastaðir cookies – Bessastaðakökur,"These cookies have been baked in the family of Vigdís Finnbogadóttir (born 1930) for as long as Vigdís can remember. When she moved to the Icelandic presidential residence of Bessastaðir on the Álftanes peninsula as president (the first democratically elected female head of state in the world!), she brought the cookie recipe with her and during her term in office (1980 - 1996) these cookies were regularly served with coffee to all visitors offered, always served in a silver bowl. The cookies have a very special relationship with the Bessastaðir farm: The recipe for the cookies is said to go back to Jakobína Jónsdóttir . Jakobína was the wife of Grímur Þorgrímsson Thomsen and lived with her husband in the manor on Álftanes. Grímur Thomsen was born on Bessastaðir in 1820. At that time, the Reykjavík secondary school was located in the buildings (until 1846) and Grímur's father was a school superintendent here. Grímur studied in Copenhagen and worked for several years in the Danish Foreign Service before he moved back to Iceland and in 1867 he acquired the now empty Bessastaðir farm from the Danish king in exchange for his land in Borgarfjörður.   Three years later, at the age of 50, Grímur married 35-year-old Jakobína and the couple lived together on Bessastaðir. Grímur died in 1896 in the same room in which he was born in 1820. Grímur Thomsen is considered one of the most important poets of Icelandic Romanticism; one of his most famous poems is the equestrian song ""Á Sprengisandi"", which has achieved the status of a folk song in the setting of Sigvaldi Kaldalóns in Iceland. Unfortunately, it is not known whether the cookies were still served on Bessastaðir under Vigdís' successors Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson and Guðni Th. Jóhannesson. In any case, when we were at Guðni's on the open day in August 2022, there were no cookies around.

rugbraud-icelandic-rye-bread,Rúgbrauð - Icelandic Rye Bread,"A particular specialty of Icelandic cuisine is the Icelandic rye bread, i.e. rúgbrauð. It is a bit similar to pumpernickel, but it is soft and fluffy and tastes sweet. Baking bread with the heat of the earthTraditionally, this bread is baked in Iceland’s geothermally heated ground, then usually in a tin can, which is buried in the ground for 10 - 24 hours (depending on the temperature on site). This bread is known, for example, from Heimaey after the volcanic eruption in 1973, from the region on Mývatn or from the geothermal bakery at the swimming pool ""Fontana"" in Laugarvatn.An oven of the village communityIn some places, however, there are also communal ""ovens"" where the inhabitants can bake their rye bread in special devices with the hot steam of geothermal energy. A friend of ours lives here, and she showed me her ""oven"". In this steaming ""tin barrel"", there is a grid, on which you place a milk carton filled with your dough. Then you push the lid down again and screw it down. Then the bread bakes in hot steam. On the next day the rúgbrauð is ready. But in fact, you need at least two people when you put your dough in here, because the barrel is really hot, and I would have had big problems to screw down the lid on my own. Slow baking - baking time 12 to 24 hoursIf you don't have geothermal energy available, you can also bake your rúgbrauð in the oven. Here I have  a recipe for you, which  is prepared with ab-mjólk (a special probiotic thick milk) or alternatively with yogurt. The bread is baked classically in empty, washed-out milk cartons (32 fl. oz. resp. 1 l) - here for about 11 hours at 200 °F (90 °C).

lummur-ab-mjolk,Pancakes with AB mjólk – Lummur (ab-mjólk),"AB-mjólk is a special Icelandic dairy product, a sour, thick, probiotic milk made with the help of the special bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus (a) and Bifidobacterium bididum (b). Many Icelanders swear that ab-mjólk improves their digestion and strengthens their immune system. You can get a large selection of ab-mjólk in practically every supermarket here - and of course it is also used in Icelandic cuisine, for example in these thick little pancakes. In other countries you often can't get ab-mjólk, but you can replace it in the recipe with pure yoghurt. So a perfect Sunday breakfast for two, right?!?

I already have a number of cinnamon roll recipes on the blog, including my absolute favorite cinnamon roll recipe .

lambathrihyrningar-med-feta,Lamb triangles with feta – Lambaþríhyrningar með feta,"Icelandic finger food - This time I baked puff pastries filled with minced lamb mince for our planned hiking tour.By the way, finger food means ""pinnamatur"" in Icelandic, the word is also used for ""appetizer"". When shopping, however, I only had problems when I was searching for minced meat in our local supermarket - there was no fresh minced meat in the cold room, only hamburgers, so I looked in the freezers - and at first I found nothing, because I was looking for the wrong shape or packaging. But then we were successful: minced meat is sold frozen here in Iceland in ""sausage form"", there were optional pork, beef, horsemeat and mutton. So we bought a roll of ""kindahack"" (= chopped mutton) which I then thawed at home before baking. (My ""minced sausage"" had 635 g, for the lamb triangles that was a bit too much - well, doesn't matter, so our son got noodles wth minced meat for lunch!)

For this dish, in addition to the AB mjólk, you use commercial pesto that you can get in the store, green or red pesto depending on your taste, you can also mix both, just as you like. For other countries, where AB mjólk is not available, I recomment to use pure yogurt instead of AB mjólk, which comes closest to the result.

Banana bread has been very popular in Iceland since both banana plants and banana bread recipes came to the country with the US soldiers stationed here on the island during World War II. The plants thrive very well in the greenhouses in Hveragerði and the surrounding area, which are heated with geothermal energy. Banana bread is also ideal for using up leftover bananas that have already turned a little brown.

uppahaldskanilsnudar-minir,My favorite cinnamon rolls – Uppáhaldskanilsnúðar mínir,"Do you also know that some recipes change somehow over time? I've tried many different Icelandic cinnamon roll recipes in my life, but somehow I stuck with a basic recipe that I've been baking for (what feels like) 15 years at every school or kindergarten party where I have to bring something - and for family birthdays anyway. Cinnamon rolls always work! But this basic recipe has also undergone some changes over the last 10 years, some of which I have picked up and adopted from other cinnamon roll recipes. I'm also baking vegan more and more often, especially for parties, simply because most people can eat it - and here I think the vegan version tastes perfect! The recipe was originally made with wheat flour and milk. I quickly replaced the wheat flour with spelled flour. Instead of cow's milk, I now use soy-based vanilla milk (after first using oat milk, then almond milk and finally almond-vanilla milk). And compared to the original basic recipe, there is more melted margarine here, which makes the dough much smoother, easier to work with and also becomes wonderfully crispy when baked.   I baked these cinnamon rolls for child 4's school class this week - and they were really well received by everyone. We saved some for the rest of the family - and Child 2 and his girlfriend in particular really raved about this cinnamon roll version.

kleinur-arid-1800,Kleinur anno 1800 – Kleinur árið 1800,"Now things are getting very culinary and historical here: Kleinur is made from a recipe that is almost 222 years old. The recipe comes from the oldest Icelandic cookbook - published in 1800. Marta María Stephensen is the author on the cookbook. Marta María Stephensen (1770 - 1805) Marta María Diðriksdóttir Hölter Stephensen was the daughter of a Danish merchant who traded in Iceland. In June 1790, Marta Maria married the Icelandic lawyer Stéfan Stephensen (1767 - 1820) in Copenhagen - although without his parents' knowledge. After the wedding, the couple went to Iceland and lived on Borgarfjörður, first near Akranes and Borganes, later in Hvítarvellir at the mouth of the Hvítá River. Marta María died here in June 1805 at the age of 34, after 15 years of marriage, giving birth to her 10th child. All but one of her children, 5 sons and 4 daughters, survived. Her brother-in-law, Magnús Stephensen (1760 - 1833), was also a lawyer and was appointed presiding judge of the newly created Supreme Court of Iceland in 1801. He also published several magazines, was very committed to education, published a number of books on law, history and theology and even owned his own printing company. The “ Simple Cookbook for Housewives of Upscale Gentlemen ” was also published in this printing company in 1800. The book was the first printed Icelandic cookbook - and the first book by an Icelandic woman, or so it is said. However, it is now certain that the majority of the cookbook was actually written by Magnús himself in the winter of 1783/84, possibly supplemented later by Marta María. Magnús then published the cookbook under his sister-in-law's name. Unfortunately, I don't know why Magnús named his sister-in-law Marta María Stephensen as the author - whether he had concerns that it could damage his very successful career as a lawyer if it became known that he had written a cookbook...? Or did he think that a cookbook for the upscale housewife would not be bought by potential buyers if it had been written by a man? Magnús himself only wrote in his biography that he published the book in the name of Marta María because it ""suited her better"". The book can now be found online as a PDF document on the Internet.  § 97 - Kleinur  However, the recipe for Kleinur reads astonishingly imprecise by today's standards: For the Kleinur you need wheat flour, depending on how much you want, a little grated lemon peel if you have it, 3 or 4 tablespoons of sour cream, a small fistful of sugar and a few eggs.

These dishes seem to come in countless different variations. We once had a version with leek, bacon and salami - my youngest is a big salami fan. Depending on how many people you expect to eat, you can adjust the quantity of the recipe wonderfully. For many guests, you can also prepare large portions in a deep baking tray. By the way, you can also prepare the dish the day before: Then you prepare everything, stack it in the tin and instead of putting it in the oven, you cover it airtight and put it in the fridge. The next day, when the guests are there, you preheat the oven and simply put the prepared dish in the oven.

I thought the little guy was so cute that I really wanted to ""recreate"" him in culinary terms, and finally I thought, flat bottom and then a (half) ball on top... that screams Sörur , the typical Icelandic cream cookies with almonds, a topping of buttercream and then covered with chocolate. Finally, I experimented a bit - and based on a classic Sörur recipe, I ended up with these sweet little guys. Oh, I'm completely in love myself! And the guys taste delicious too! By the way, I used silicone molds for the hemispheres with a diameter of approx. 5 cm.

vegan-kleinur,Vegan Kleinur – Vegan kleinur,"When I present a vegan version of a typical Icelandic dish, a pastry is of course an absolute must - Kleinur . A Kleina is a small particle fried in fat that probably originally comes from Denmark, but has been very common and popular in Iceland for a long time. In English, the Kleinur here are often referred to as "" Icelandic twisted donuts "". (It's said that back in the day people even occasionally fried their Kleinur in fish oil, but that didn't catch on in Iceland either - for good reasons if you ask me!) Traditionally Kleinur are prepared with milk, Skyr or sour milk, often with an egg - this vegan version replaces the egg with ground linseed and apple cider vinegar, instead of milk / Skyr / sour milk I used almond milk. I admit, this vegan version tastes a little bit different than “traditional” Kleinur, but it comes close to the feeling of the classic Kleinur - and the vegan Kleinur are really extremely tasty!

So it's also a recipe from the ""always vegan"" category. I just added a bit of baking powder to the flour. The bread is traditionally still baked directly on the hot stove, of course completely without fat. But before I slapped the dough directly onto my ceramic hob, I preferred to use my good cast iron pan.

With the introduction of the new, imported foods pasta and rice, pearl barley was increasingly displaced in everyday Icelandic cuisine. Noodles and rice are purely imported products that cannot be produced on Iceland itself - in contrast to the traditional pearl barley, which grows here regionally and in organic quality. Eymundur Magnússon and Eyglo Björk Ólafsdóttur, the operators of the organic farm "" móðir jörð "" (= Mother Earth) near Egilsstaðir, have set themselves the goal of bringing pearl barley back into the kitchens of Icelanders. Their pearl barley can now be found in many Icelandic supermarkets and on their farm Vallanes in the East Fjords you can enjoy a very tasty buffet with many different barley preparations.   Buffet in Vallanes On the Vallanes homepage they also present a number of recipes that we have already published on the blog. One of her classic Icelandic pearl barley recipes is this kale and barley risotto, which with vegan cream is definitely just the thing for vegans who want to get a taste of typical Icelandic cuisine!

Of course you can also prepare your own Christmas beer. However, opinions differ when it comes to the mixing ratio : Malt beer and Appelsín are usually mixed in a ratio of 1:1, but variants such as 45% malt beer, 45% Appelsín and 10% cola or a can of Appelsín, 1.5 cans of malt beer and 1/2 can of light beer are also popular. Sometimes hvítöl is used instead of malt beer and mixed with Appelsín, a classic Danish light beer with an alcohol content of around 2.5% and a high sugar content. In this Christmas beer recipe, I enriched the traditional mixture of malt beer and Appelsín with ground spices and honey.

gulrota-og-bananakaka,Carrot and banana cake – Gulróta- og Bananakaka,"It's slowly approaching the Christmas season... next Sunday is already the 1st Advent! This recipe for a carrot-banana cake or perhaps a carrot-banana bread goes a bit in that autumnal-Christmas direction, as a gentle introduction. It tastes delicious, but isn't too sweet and reminds you a bit that it's called ""banana bread"", not ""banana cake""... but even in Icelandic cuisine it doesn't always have to be a sugar shock!

cozy-afternoon-in-a-cafe,...with a hot licorice chocolate – Cozy afternoon in a cafe...,"We recently went to Reykjavík on a Saturday afternoon - took a trip into the city. We wanted to meet up with a friend and took the opportunity to look for old cookbooks in the second-hand shop, take a quick trip to the sea, and then stroll through the city together and make ourselves comfortable in the café close. By the way, the licorice hot chocolate was so delicious that I had to recreate it at home! Here, after browsing in the second-hand shop, we took a short detour to Vesturbær, ended up parking at Hofsvallagata and walked a few steps along the sea. Oh yes, I love the air here by the sea!   From here you have a beautiful view over Álftanes and Bessastaðir, the seat of the Icelandic president.   In the background you can clearly see Mount Keilir, with its beautiful, striking cone shape.   And here's another view of Reykjavík's domestic airport - nice and small and manageable, right?!? We then parked here near the airport at the university and walked into the city, it's not that far here.      Because the weather was quite cold and damp, we went to a café on Laugavegur and warmed up with plenty of delicious drinks. The pumpkin spice frappó and the licorice hot chocolate were particularly delicious!   Afterwards we went back home...   And because the hot chocolate with licorice at the cafe in Reykjavík was so delicious, I tried to recreate a recipe for ""heitt súkkulaði með lakkrís"". Yes, it turned out delicious too!

prinsakonfekt,Prins Póló confectionery – Prinsakonfekt,"""Prince Polo"" chocolate bars come from Poland, but are very popular in Iceland and can be found in practically every supermarket and gas station in the country. There are also many recipes with these chocolate bars. (If you don't have any Prince Polo bars at hand, you can of course make do with other similar bars, such as KitKat.) The sweet balls were very well received by my family! (I clearly need to make the balls again for Child3, and maybe we'll get a little more out of them then.)

(Incidentally, bjúgu used to be the classic lunch on the day before Christmas Eve, on Þorláksmessa.) The sausage “bjúga” is made from horse, pork or beef. It consists of meat that is put through a meat grinder and the sausages are then salted and smoked. This gives the sausage its very special, intense smoky taste. I found it to take a bit of getting used to, but ultimately quite tasty! By the way, our horse sausages here were traditionally served in a white sauce with potatoes or mashed potatoes as well as peas and red cabbage.

I got the recipe from a baking book with Sunday cake recipes throughout the year that I recently bought in Reykjavík at a second-hand shop in Reykjavík, the Nytjamarkaður Samhjálpar. Samhjálp is a charity that, among other things, runs a home for addicts and distributes food to those in need. This work is largely financed from the proceeds of the second-hand shop on Ármúli in Reykjavík. The selection of books they had there was manageable, but relatively sorted - and they also had some interesting cookbooks. And the Sunday Cake book really made me, a cake lover, happy!

braudterta,Bread pie – Brauðterta,"What the Swedes have their “smörgåstårta” is what the Icelanders have their “brauðterta”. In Iceland, a hearty bread cake is traditionally found among sweet pastries on buffet tables, from family celebrations to Christmas invitations. It is a savory cake with lots of filling and garnishes, similar to a layered cream cake. The bread cake consists of several layers of bread (usually toast) with rich, creamy fillings in between. The basis of the creams is usually mayonnaise and eggs, and you can basically vary them indefinitely according to your mood, taste and preferences. Traditionally, fresh or smoked salmon and crabs, ham, lamb, etc. are often used, but vegan fillings are of course also possible. The only important thing is that the different layers harmonize with each other in terms of taste and that nothing tastes too bad.   The bread cake is lavishly decorated and served well chilled; the ""cake"" is cut like a dessert cake. In Iceland, you buy the bread for the Brauðterta frozen from the supermarket, then let it thaw in the fridge overnight and then prepare the cake the next day. Of course, you can also bake the toast yourself - or buy ready-made toast bread, cut off the edge and then shape the slices. For the recipe here, I chose three different fillings - one ham, one smoked lamb and one hard-boiled eggs. But this can really be varied as desired!

kanilsnudar,Cinnamon rolls – Kanilsnúðar,"You can never have enough cinnamon roll recipes - but this recipe really drove me crazy the first time I tried it! I baked it for the first time in mid-August for child3's birthday - but it went wrong; The dough just didn't do what it was supposed to, wouldn't roll up, and looked pretty pitiful afterwards. The taste is okay, but that's not how baking is supposed to work! So I tried it again a few days later for Child2's birthday, changed things a bit - and the dough was much easier to work with. Then brushed with a little milk and sprinkled with brown sugar before baking - then the result was not only really tasty, but also visually presentable!

You can also find a number of curry dishes here in the blog, including lamb curry or curry fish casserole . I found a recipe for ""egg í karrí"", i.e. ""eggs in curry"", which I found in an old cookbook from the 1940s particularly exciting - to be served ""warm as a dessert for lunch"".

Yes, I know it's not necessarily classic Icelandic, but certain Asian influences are becoming more and more common in the cuisine here. I always have to think of an Icelandic (television) chef (now unfortunately deceased) who loved cooking with coconut and especially coriander... he was ""allowed"" to do that in his fish soup, but his regular guests mutinied when it came to his fish balls - to his genuine grief... We then ""spiced up"" the cauliflower soup with a little Umami Sjávarsalt - I didn't have any vegetable broth anymore, only meat broth, but the lamb would have been tasty and that wouldn't have been right either. So we had to season it a bit afterwards - but this vegan salt with its slightly smoky flavors was really good with it!

And this no-bake cheesecake with licorice chocolate and a base made from ground oatmeal cookies is really really delicious, I could have fooled myself! Even though my husband complained while he was working on the oatmeal cookies with the rolling pin - normally the recipe would say how to bake cookies from flour, not how to make flour out of cookies... but he was thrilled with the result!   For the licorice chocolate I used Þristur , my personal favorite licorice chocolate here in Iceland.

So the next time we went shopping we took a look at Ljótur - and definitely found it very tasty. The cheese is less crumbly than the normal Gráðostur and looks impressively ugly from the outside, but tastes wonderful to us! Some of the cheese went straight into this recipe for spicy cheese biscuits. We had visitors in the evening and I wanted to put at least one tasty little something on the table.

Incidentally, in Icelandic, ""broccoli"" is actually called ""spergilkál"", or ""asparagus cabbage"", because the taste of the stalks is said to have reminded one of the first Icelandic foods of asparagus. Broccoli is sometimes also referred to as “sprotakál”, i.e. “sprouted cabbage”. The term “brokkóli” is now also quite common in Iceland.

And Icelanders love ice cream. So it's no wonder that you find (what feels like) several recipes for coffee ice cream in every old Icelandic cookbook! I already have a recipe for coffee ice cream with lots of cream on the blog and also a recipe for coffee ice cream with sweetened condensed milk , and here I found a very simple recipe, but I substituted some of the cream with vanilla.

In Iceland it feels like midsummer starts at 60 °F (15 °C) at the latest, people wear flip-flops and tank tops and shorts. While the model tourists are of course still walking around in windbreakers, long trousers and thick hiking boots. I think 60 °F (15 °C) in Iceland really feels much warmer than the same temperature in most other countries... So if you want to be prepared for the next heat wave (even if it is only an Iceland ""heatwave""), I can recommend this iced ""milk coffee"" as a drink to cool you down. (For various reasons, we only have it with decaffeinated coffee. But it tastes good too!)

It is said that for the first time in 1780 an Icelandic student from Copenhagen reported in a letter about ""chócolade-drykkur"", i.e. a ""chocolate drink"". But it wasn't until the middle of the 19th century that hot chocolate became more popular as a drink in Iceland, albeit as a drink for adults, as it tasted relatively bitter. The Síríus company then imported the first chocolate from Denmark to Iceland in 1896, later bought by the Icelandic confectionery company Nói hf. The Síríus chocolate factory in Copenhagen opened and from 1933 chocolate was also produced in Iceland. In addition to the chocolate from Nói Síríus, I can also recommend the chocolate from the Icelandic company Omnom.

raekjusalat,Crab salad – Rækjusalat,"I really enjoy eating crabs, but unfortunately the rest of my family doesn't. That's why we rarely have a dish with crab - but I really wanted to try this recipe for a crab salad, it sounded so wonderfully simple! We also had it with freshly baked bread for dinner - so no one had to eat crab salad if they didn't want to. Child no. 3 also approached very hesitantly with a ""Gee, that looks disgusting!"", but tried a small spoonful of the crab salad on his bread, thought about it - then took another small spoonful and said: ""This tastes right for crabs yummy!"" I'll take that as a compliment...!

koriander-kjuklingur,Cilantro chicken – Kóríander-Kjúklingur,"When I use coriander in Icelandic recipes, I always think of the Icelandic chef, television chef and author Magnús Ingi Magnússon. Unfortunately he passed away in November 2019. We met him when we ate at his restaurant Sjávarbarinn in Reykjavík in the summer of 2018. Back then, he raved to us about how much he liked adding coriander to his dishes. But unfortunately his regular customers had no idea and insisted that their plokkfiskur and fiskibollur must continue to taste exactly the way they had learned these dishes from their grandmother as a child. But at least he could add his beloved coriander to his absolutely delicious seafood soup... In any case, I like to use coriander sometimes - and think of Magnús with a smile. I tried a recipe for coriander chicken here.

One theory says that the name goes back to a trade embargo by Emperor Napoleon on cane sugar - since cane sugar became unaffordable for many people due to the import ban, they had to resort to extracting sugar from beets, and then they could - despite the trade embargo of Emperor Napoleon - still bring sugary sweet cake to the table.

falleg-gulrotarterta,Great cake - carrot cake – Falleg gulrótarterta,"Well, that's what happens when I watch baking shows on TV... The show we watched together was about getting inspiration for a themed cake from a picture (= flower vase with flowers by van Gogh). Somehow I found the idea exciting. So I looked for a picture/motive that I consider to be “typically Icelandic” and that also has a certain “recognition effect”. My first thought was graffiti painting, which is very typical of Reykjavík, but my husband wasn't convinced - and then came up with the brilliant idea: Let Kattakaffihús inspire you!   Reykjavik, summer 2018 We were guests at Kattakaffihús, the “cat café” in Reykjavík, in the summer of 2018. The idea of ​​a cat café actually comes from Asia - here cat lovers who cannot keep their own cat can relax in a cozy atmosphere with coffee and cake and cuddle with cats if they want. Homeless cats are often taken in and can then find a new person in the café. The world's first cat café was probably opened in Taiwan in 1998, such cafés have also been available in Europe since 2012 and in March 2018 the ""Kattakaffihúsið"" opened in Bergstaðastræti in Reykjavík, just around 500 m from Hallgrímskirkja. Kattakaffihús serves coffee and other hot and cold drinks, various cakes, pastries and also sandwiches, often vegan. (Some of it comes from the pastry shop ""17 Sortir"", whose range has made me smile so many times at the old harbor in Grandi and now in Kringlan.) I'm making my theme cake In any case, I decided to let these typical cat representations inspire me for my Icelandic themed cake. As the base for the cake, I baked a typical Icelandic carrot cake, actually more of a carrot cake, with two layers and lots of cream cheese filling and cream. I then “colored” the cream a little with apricot jam. I preferred not to use food coloring for the coating, as I was more interested in the most natural taste and natural

valentinusardagur-2021,Valentine's Day 2021 – Valentínusardagur 2021,"In Iceland they don't actually celebrate Valentine's Day, but rather ""Men's Day"" and ""Women's Day"", ""bóndadagur"" and ""konudagur"". "" Men's Day "" falls on the first day of the Old Icelandic winter month of Þorri, which is the first Friday between January 19th and 25th. According to old lore from the 18th century, tradition required that the master of the house be the first to arrive on the farm on this day and he would greet the winter month appropriately. In return, the housewife should “treat her husband well” on this particular day. Later (probably only in the 19th century) "" Women's Day "" was added, on the first day of the winter month of Góa, i.e. on the first Sunday between February 18th and 24th. Here the husbands were supposed to celebrate their housewife with the beginning of the month of Góa, which brought with it the rising light and the arrival of the first signs of spring. However, the tradition of husbands honoring their housewives by giving them flowers on Women's Day came later - the first newspaper advertisement from the Icelandic Association of Gardeners and Florists calling on men to give flowers to their wives on ""konudagur"". buy, apparently dates from 1957.   Icelandic beer, Icelandic chocolate and a little flower, the man of the house and the housewife can both feel well treated.  Valentine's Day in Iceland Valentine's Day has less significance in Iceland; it was first mentioned in an article in the daily newspaper Morgunblaðið from 1958, in which it was reported that florists in Reykjavík had made small bouquets of flowers to sell on Valentine's Day.   Quick Valentine's Day gift - simply homemade If any of you need a quick Valentine's Day gift for your loved one or spouse by Sunday - I could recommend my recipe for licorice chocolate . All you need is 100 g of chocolate , 25 g of couverture and 40 g of licorice wheels . The chocolate and the couverture are then melted in a glass in a water bath. The licorice wheels are unrolled, divided and then nicely chopped with a chopping knife or similar. The licorice pieces are then added to the melted chocolate...  ...mix the whole thing thoroughly and then pour it into praline molds using two teaspoons or something similar.  Then put the licorice chocolate in the fridge for at least 2 hours and let it solidify. Your homemade, sweet Valentine’s Day gift is ready! [Translated from here.]

The festival is celebrated solemnly and with lots of hearty food, often in the form of rich buffets.

hindberja-og-ferskjuduett,Raspberry-peach duet – Hindberja- og ferskjudúett,"Here in Iceland, some things are a little different than we might be used to in other countries. I actually wanted to try this recipe for a raspberry-peach duet with skyr, but in Krambúð, the small shop I was in, there were no frozen peaches, only mango, and frozen fruit only in 250 g bags. So I had a mango-raspberry duet in equal parts. Also delicious. I then sprinkled some desiccated coconut on top.

stora-sara,Giant Sara – Stóra-Sara,"These cookies with ground almonds / marzipan, butter cream and chocolate coating are often found in Scandinavia, in very different versions. By the way, the original recipe is a Danish invention in honor of the French actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844 - 1923): the crowds cheered her on her first visit to Copenhagen in 1880. When she visited Denmark again in 1911 to present her biography, one of Copenhagen's leading patisseries is said to have created this pastry in her honor. In Denmark there is ""Sarah Bernhardt Kager"", in Sweden there is ""biskvier"" - and in Iceland a piece is called ""Sara"" and in the plural it is ""Sörur"". By the way, it is typical of Icelandic recipes that there is still a bit of coffee flavor in the cream. I already have several recipes for ""Sörur"" here on the blog, in addition to the classic version with marzipan there is also a version with licorice . When I came across a recipe for a giant Sara as a ""cake"" in an Icelandic magazine with Christmas recipes, I immediately knew - I had to try it!

graenkalssalalat-med-blaberjasosu,Kale salad with blueberry dressing – Grænkálssalalat með bláberjasósu,"My keyword today is seasonal food: I always have to get used to the fact that a lot of things in Iceland are different than I know from Germany. For example, rhubarb is in season in Germany from the beginning of April to mid-June - in Iceland the season starts a little later, but fresh rhubarb is still available until September. Or kale - a typical winter vegetable in Germany. As a child, I often heard that kale should only be harvested after the first frost. In Iceland, on the other hand, kale is available all summer long. In fact, kale doesn't necessarily need frost to convert starch into sugar, but rather, ripe kale hardly contains any starch that could be converted, but continues to form glucose through photosynthesis - so it's not really about ""the first frost"" when it comes to kale, but rather to the generally low temperatures. Of course, that's not a problem in Iceland - the temperatures are low in summer. Our neighbor just told us that his potato plants froze last week because there was already night frost. So it's probably only fitting that kale in Iceland isn't limited to the winter season!

saft-is,Juice ice cream – Saft-ís,"The recipe here comes from my old Icelandic cookbook from 1945 - and you can see the stocks that were naturally used back then. The strawberry ice cream here is not made with fresh strawberries, but with strawberry jam and red fruit juice. Oh, juice is usually called ""safi"" in Icelandic, but if you really specifically mean fruit juice, it's also ""saft"" in Icelandic.

bakadur-hafragrautur,Baked porridge – Bakaður hafragrautur,"Actually, I got to know this dish as a ""Sunday breakfast for the whole family"", according to the motto ""everyone finally likes oat flakes"" - after all, hafragrautur (= porridge) is a very common breakfast for Icelanders, especially for Icelandic children. I can't just eat this for breakfast though!

snudar,Rolls with glaze – Snúðar,"In Iceland, Mother's Day is also celebrated on the 2nd Sunday in May, or as it is called in Icelandic, Mother's Day (""mæðradagur""). With that in mind, if you want, I wish you all a happy Mother's Day! Gleðilegan mæðradag! I baked ours - a big batch of cinnamon rolls. My children eat them in pretty much all situations. And the rolls can easily be prepared the day before, so that I have “free” on Mother’s Day and can enjoy the day in peace.

rabarbarapae,Rhubarb pie – Rabarbarapæ,"Whether you call the dessert a ""pie"" (Icelandic onomatopoeically called ""pæ"") or a pastry, cake or crumble is ultimately secondary - the main thing is that it tastes really delicious. And I think it does! It's best served a little warm with vanilla sauce and ice cream... This recipe is also really easy and uncomplicated to prepare.

trollasurugrautur,Rhubarb porridge – Tröllasúrugrautur,"Over the course of my life, I have become an avowed rhubarb fan. This is very fitting, as rhubarb has long been an essential part of Icelandic cuisine since its introduction to Iceland around 1880. The recipe here is from the 1940s, when rhubarb was still called ""tröllasúra"" in Icelandic and not ""rabarbari"".

kreppukaka,Crisis cake – Kreppukaka,"The times now are crying out for a crisis cake... The recipe for this cake probably comes from the time of the global economic crisis in 1929, when there were supply shortages and many people had no money. In order to bake, you had to make do with recipes without milk and eggs, and if in doubt also without butter. However, this is a slightly more opulent version of the ""crisis cake"" of the time, with butter cream and chocolate. I tried the recipe because of the current situation. To return to the current crisis:  When it comes to Corona, the current numbers from Iceland currently look very encouraging. At the daily press conference on Friday it was reported that no sample had tested positive within the last 24 hours, meaning that no new infection had been detected. There was one positive sample on Saturday - however, 193 samples were evaluated on Friday and 685 samples on Saturday, which is also a particular success. At the press conference today on Sunday it was announced that there were 2 positive tests in the last 24 hours, out of a total of 381 samples evaluated. A total of around 46,000 Icelanders have been tested for Corona so far, around 12.9% of the entire population. There have been 1,792 positive tests so far, i.e. 3.9% of all tests. There are currently 174 people in Iceland who are Corona positive.

Plus, it takes less than half an hour for the rolls to be ready and on the table and they are wonderfully fluffy - I can do that quickly even on a Sunday morning!

latar-ponnukokur-med-berjum,Lazy pancakes with berries – Latar pönnukökur með berjum,"These ""pancakes"" are called ""lazy pancakes"" because you don't bake the batter one after the other in the pan while busily standing at the stove, but simply pour the entire batter into a mold at once and then let it bake in the oven in peace. As far as I can find, this recipe originally comes from Finland, but it is also popular in Iceland. In any case, I find it extremely practical if I can prepare breakfast and simply put it in the oven and then still have time to get up and get ready in peace!

Fish is also a typical Good Friday dish in Iceland, even if this tradition has been somewhat forgotten in recent decades. My Good Friday fish this year would be this smoked cod - smoked with thyme sprigs in a smoker bag, either on the grill or with the grill function in the oven. And with a very tasty sauce on the side. The thyme grows in our “herb garden” at the front door.

And when I looked for recipes for rauðrófu salad on the Internet and found pictures with arugula on the side... Oh, wonderful, that fits! I also had walnuts and goat cheese.

This chocolate cake can also be found in this and similar form under other names in Iceland - and in other quantities. I once heard of a recipe with 15 eggs, but that was probably intended for a whole baking tray for hungry hotel guests. Then enjoy the cake in small portions - it is really quite powerful, but very tasty!

langafasta,Lent – Langafasta,"On Shrove Monday, people in Iceland celebrate ""bolludagur"", on this day people traditionally eat balls made of yeast dough, sponge dough or choux pastry filled with cream, jam or chocolate. On “Sprengidagur“, Shrove Tuesday, you eat your fill again, with lots of meat and fatty foods. While in the past people ate their fill mainly on Hangikjöt, since the end of the 19th century the traditional dish for Shrove Tuesday has been Saltkjöt og Baunir . And on Ash Wednesday, “öskudagur”, Lent, “langafasta”, begins. It used to be a time of inner contemplation; people did not eat meat during Lent until Easter, and some people also fasted on fish or milk/dairy products.  My Skyr diet This year I decided to eat as consciously and as protein-rich as possible during Lent - this year I want to try a Skyr diet, i.e. Skyr as an essential ingredient in my dishes. Due to our spontaneous trip to Iceland to buy a house, I'm not quite on schedule, so I'll gradually add the dishes here to the list in the near future!

kryddadar-jolakleinur,Spiced Christmas treats – Kryddaðar jólakleinur,"I'm often asked what the ""sour milk"" is in my recipes; you don't necessarily know that from the supermarket in your country. Sour milk or curdled milk is soured milk that has lactic acid bacteria added to it to thicken it. Sour milk is quite thick and tastes slightly sour. You can sometimes also get it as “Swedish milk” in the supermarket.

kaest-skata-med-hnodmor,Rotten rays with kneaded fat – Kæst skata með hnoðmör,"The typical food in Iceland for December 23rd, Saint Þorlákur's Day, eaten at the Þorláksmessa is kæst skata, i.e. rotten rays with kneaded fat. It's the smelliest food I've ever personally encountered, and even some Icelanders say that it's specially served on the 23rd, so that everything the housewife serves you at Christmas seems great, no matter how it tastes. But you can probably get used to the taste of rotten rays over time. Star rays are usually used for the kæst skata. Since the ray does not have a urinary bladder but - like all plate gills - accumulates its urea in the blood, the star ray is only suitable for human consumption if it has been fermented for at least 4 weeks. Even then, the smell is still overwhelming With the rotten ray you traditionally eat boiled potatoes, freshly baked Icelandic rye bread, called Rúgbrauð, and - and this is where it gets critical again - kneaded fat or visceral fat. This fat, called ""hnoðmör"" or ""mörflot"", is a very typically Icelandic specialty that originally comes from the Westfjords, but has now spread throughout Iceland.  For the ""hnoðmör"" the fat is separated from the stomach of the freshly slaughtered sheep as intact as possible. The fat is then kneaded and formed into ""dumplings"", which are left to firm up a little overnight. The next day, the ""dumplings"" are individually wrapped in pieces of linen or gauze and hung outside in a place that is as windy as possible but at the same time somewhat sheltered from the rain. The whole thing is then left hanging in the bags for 6 to 8 weeks until the fat has turned blue-green and hairy. If it's too cold outside and the fat isn't furry enough, bring it back into the kitchen for 2 or 3 days to let it ""ripen"". The blue-green, furry-hairy fat is then chopped into small pieces, kneaded well, formed into cubes in portions and then stored in a cool place. In the Westfjords, a St. Andrew's cross was carved into one side of the finished pieces of plasticine, probably a religious, magical custom, a kind of ""protective symbol"" against evil spirits. They say this is to prevent the devil from getting into the kneaded fat...  By the way, the kneaded fat has a very intense smell when cold; you could also say that it stinks, even if it is kept frozen. When warmed up, it doesn't smell nearly as bad and, even for inexperienced palates, it may not be particularly enjoyable, but at least it's not actively bad. The smell of the rotten ray, on the other hand, is much, much worse... When preparing this dish, you should also think about those around you - if possible, you shouldn't necessarily cook it in a small kitchen in a large apartment building without any real ventilation options and you should definitely pay attention to draft when cooking. Some recommend cooking it on the camp stove behind the garage... And if you prefer to use salted water instead of unsalted water to cook the stingray, the salt will probably temper the impact of the smell and taste somewhat. Traditionally, kæst skata is served with boiled potatoes and fresh rye bread. Preparation 
Place the rotten ray in boiling, unsalted water and simmer until the meat separates from the cartilage.  Meanwhile, cook the potatoes, skip the kneaded fat and cut the Rúgbrauð into slices and then serve the meal straight away.  Bon appetit - at least it's a very special pre-Christmas experience!  PS: Leftover food If there is any leftover food from the evening of December 23rd, you can use it to prepare a typical Icelandic breakfast for the next morning, namely ""skötustappa"": After eating, mash the fish meat with the cooked potatoes, the melted kneaded fat and a little salt into a thick paste, let the paste cool down well and store it in the refrigerator overnight (be sure to store it in an airtight container or something similar!). The next morning, cut the rye bread into nice thick slices, spread with butter and spread the ""skötostappa"" on the bread - the perfect breakfast for a Christmas in the Icelandic Westfjords!

In many families it is a nice pre-Christmas tradition to meet on one day in November or early December and all make Laufabrauð together and lovingly and individually decorate the dough flatbreads by hand with patterns before they are fried in hot fat. There are special ""Laufabrauðsjárn"", i.e. ""leaf bread irons"", now often made of brass, with which you can ""stamp"" the patterns directly into the dough flatbreads using a small wheel. I still dream of having my own ""Laufabrauðsjárn"" - and until then I'll make do with a nice sharp knife. This Laufabrauð recipe here comes from an old Icelandic cookbook by Jónina Sigurðardóttir from 1945 that I bought at the flea market in Reykjavík.

(When it was well cooled, the cake was easier to cut and my son liked it better - but my husband didn't.) On the other hand - it's a very Icelandic recipe, so I don't want to ignore it without comment, this dish doesn't deserve that. Well - a bit difficult this time...

Horse meat is relatively common in Northern Iceland in particular, but you can also get it in supermarkets in Reykjavík. Horse meat is considered healthy (because it is low in fat and rich in iron). When processing horse meat, however, the age of the slaughtered animal is very important - the younger the animal, the softer the meat. With older animals, you have to remember that the meat has to be cooked much longer to become soft than common types of meat such as beef, pork or poultry. The horse meat that I bought in Iceland obviously came from older animals, in any case it took a good 3 hours until it finally became soft.

The term “old rye bread cake” is also appropriate because the recipe is actually a perfect way to use up leftover old Rúgbrauð that has become too dry. My husband thinks the cake tastes a bit like Christmas to him - I think I'll think about a special Christmas luxury version of it... I still have a little time until Christmas baking!

skyrdrykkur-med-greipaldini,Sky drink with grapefruit – Skyrdrykkur með greipaldini,"The recipe here came about purely by chance - I still had a grapefruit lying here from my vegetable box, and actually I had been lying here for a while, so it really had to go. As if I squeezed them out, I then squeezed out a very sour lemon in addition to the sour grapefruit (also using leftovers!), then mixed the juice with the only slightly sour Skyr - and then tempered the whole acidity a little with the honey. The result was really really tasty! Oh, pomelo or grapefruit is called “greipaldin” in Icelandic. ""Aldin"" means ""fruit"", so a tomato, for example, is also called ""rauðaldin"", i.e. ""red fruit"", in addition to ""tómatur"". And a grapefruit is a ""greipaldin"", whereby the ""greip"" has nothing to do with ""ég greip"" = ""I grabbed"", but is simply the islandized spelling of ""grape-"". Similar to ""fésbók"" for ""Facebook"", which really means ""Fratzenbuch"". Um, yeah, where was I just now?!? Back to the recipe...

You can clearly see that the cookbook was actively used! This recipe for a “fruit cake” comes from one of the recipe sheets - well, with grated apples and raisins. By the way, I like this cake best warm, with cold vanilla ice cream and chopped, roasted almonds on the side - really delicious!

PS: This salad was an absolute success, especially with my husband, and I'll definitely be making it again soon, but the salad with the onion and curry powder is a bit spicy!

So of course I didn't miss the opportunity to take part in this travel stop and contribute a typical Icelandic recipe. Iceland was settled over 1,000 years ago by Norwegian Vikings, who settled here with their families, their servants and slaves, their pets, horses, sheep, cows, chickens and pigs. They brought their recipes with them from their old homeland, including the traditional recipe for Skyr. Skyr is actually (technically) cream cheese, given the bacterial strains used, the addition of rennet and the corresponding whey formation. Pure skyr tastes quite sour, which is why Icelanders always eat it with milk or cream. Skyr basically has a nice, creamy consistency and can therefore be processed wonderfully. In the past, each farm made its own Skyr and stored it in large wooden Skyr barrels - these days, however, most Icelanders buy their Skyr quite simply in the supermarket, where there is a very large selection.  Sure, there are many different recipes for Skyr ice cream, even here on my blog, but this is one of my absolute favorite recipes!

hjonabandssaela-fra-litlibae,Happy Marriage from Litlibær – Hjónabandssæla frá Litlibæ,"Photo: Litlibær in autumn 2016 Happy Marriage from Litlibær This typical Icelandic cake is called ""Hjónabandssæla"", which means ""happy marriage"". There are several explanations for the name of the cake - perhaps because it is easy to make and gets better the longer you let it sit. Or maybe because there are as many different recipes and variations for this cake as there are recipes for a “real happy marriage”. I got this recipe for ""happy marriage"" during our stay in Iceland in July 2018 from Sigríður Hafliðadóttir, who runs the old Litlibær peat house with her husband Kritsján and her family in the summer and provides guests there with really delicious waffles, cakes, jams and drinks spoiled. I translated the recipe as literally as possible. However, I had to wait until I got rhubarb again to try it out so that I could make rhubarb jam for a Happy Marriage cake according to Sigríður's recipe.  When baking, however, I didn't completely follow Sigríður's recipe; I replaced the oat flour with soft oat flakes because I simply can't find oat flour in the usual grocery stores here. And I didn't grease the mold with butter, but lined it with baking paper. Oh, I used 3 to 4 large tablespoons of rhubarb jam, just based on how I felt.

sausages-for-vegetarians-and-vegans,Meat substitute in Icelandic – Sausages for vegetarians and vegans,"A typical Icelandic product that has long been replaced by imported products such as rice and pasta, but is now experiencing a renaissance (even in more sophisticated cuisine), is pearl barley, known as ""bankabygg"" in Icelandic. In contrast to rice and pasta, barley is grown in Iceland itself and is therefore a regional product that does not have to be imported in a laborious or expensive manner. In connection with pearl barley, I recently came across Icelandic meat substitute products for vegetarians and vegans, namely vegetarian ""sausages"" and ""Grænmetisbuff"", i.e. vegetable burgers. Both products are made from barley pearls. Pearl barley has long been traditionally used in the production of sausages in Iceland, usually in addition to meat, not instead of meat. But why not try new things? Because I'm a curious person, I tried both out right away!  The name ""Bulsur"" is a play on words from ""bygg"" (= barley) and ""pylsur"" (= sausage). The ""Bulsur"" from the Havarí company consist of barley, kidney beans, water, tomato puree, cornmeal, flour, seeds, oil, salt and other spices. In Iceland you buy them frozen in packs of four, for example in Krónan, Nettó or Hagkaup. For my 300 g pack in the Krónan Granda I have just under 900 ISK (the equivalent of around €6.60 / as of March 2019). The ""Bulsur"" are packed in a plastic wrapper, you have to remove the packaging from the individual ""sausages"" before putting them in the pan or on the grill.  The “vegetable burgers” from Móðir Jörð in Vallanes are available in two versions, one with barley and another with beetroot. I chose the beetroot version (""Rauðrófubuff""), a pack (250 g) with 4 citizens cost just under 800 ISK (approx. €5.90). Here, too, the product consists of over 40% barley, plus potatoes and beetroot (23%) as well as herbs and spices. The ""breading"" consists of pearl barley and sesame seeds, which gives the whole thing a nice, crunchy consistency on the outside. The “vegetable burgers” are heated in a pan or in the oven.  In terms of taste, I actually found both tasty - for my taste, the ""Bulsur"" had a consistency that reminded me less of sausages and more of dumplings, soft and almost a bit creamy, but they tasted nice and spicy with the fried surface it's a bit crunchy again. Because of the breading, I found the ""Rauðrófubuff"" to be very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, but not too soft, still a little bit chunky... definitely very tasty! I prepared both for lunch, the fried burgers and a pearl barley salad with fried bulsur. I'll definitely pass the recipe on to you in the next few days! [Translated from here.]

(By the way, the whole cake has about 4,700 kcal, so with 10 - 12 pieces about 400 to 470 kcal per piece or about 40 g of pure sugar per piece - already sweet.) This cake is also a bit difficult to cut - that's why there is also no photo of the cut. I still wish you bon appetite!

After an intensive price comparison, we found the 200 g pack of Harðfiskur for a good 1,200 ISK (just under €10). The ground seaweed costs around 1,000 ISK for 50 g, but you only need half a teaspoon of it... The crabs also cost around 1,000 ISK in the store. Added to this is the vegetable broth.

This is almost a “þjóðaréttur íslendinga”, i.e. a “national dish of the Icelanders”. Another ""national dish"" is plokkfiskur, which is mashed fish with mashed potatoes in a nice thick roux. At a recent competition about typical Icelandic dishes, an Icelandic woman reported that she liked having both dishes ""married together."" I found the idea very exciting and of course tried it out straight away. The recipe for the Plokkfiskur has been modified a bit, so there are no potatoes in it because “mashed potatoes in a roll” might be a bit too much of a good thing. And I intensified the taste of the fish with some blue cheese. Even though the Icelanders don't really understand plokkfiskur as fun and prefer it exactly the way their grandma used to serve it when she was a child - these ""Plokkpylsur"" with the homemade hot dog buns were really tasty!

I'm on cloud nine and will only be seen shopping or in the kitchen for the next few days.  Of course, I had to try the recipe for the ""bolludagsbollur"", through which I came across the ""ný matreiðslubók"", before Shrove Monday! By the way, we're talking about ""langaföstu snúðar"" here, or ""Fastelavnsbollur"" in Danish, meaning ""Lent dumplings"". The recipe also uses Jólabrauð dough, but you have to make the bollur ""miklu minni"", i.e. ""much smaller"". Well then, let’s get going! Oh yes - traditionally the bollur are baked here on a hotplate smeared with butter. Alternatively, you can also use a cast iron pan - these days it's easier to do that before I butter my ceramic hob!

Engiferkökur - these ginger cookies are quick and easy to prepare and taste really delicious!  Hnetusmjörskökur - these peanut butter cookies are also a very quick, simple recipe. My daughter especially loves these peanut butter cookies!   Jöklatindar - these ""glacial peaks"" owe their name to their appearance and thanks to the ground peppermint candies they also taste really refreshing!  Kryddhjörtu , or spice hearts, are one of the typical Christmas cookies in Iceland - my mother especially loves these gingerbread hearts and has even baked the recipe herself.   Kurltoppar - basically egg whites with chocolate licorice balls, this licorice meringue is my very special favorite in Christmas baking!  Maríukökur - these little ""Mary's cookies"" with ground almonds are small and delicate.  Mömmukossar are extremely delicious double cookies with a butter-sugar cream layer between two cookies.  Nammibitar - recipes with egg whites are very popular in Iceland, so here are ""sweet bites"" with egg whites, sugar, chocolate, raisins and muesli!  Smjörkex - these butter cookies are my eldest son's undisputed favorite cookies. I can barely keep up with baking!  Spesíur are small butter cookies with flour, ground almonds and chocolate lentils.  Súkkulaðismákökur - these chocolate cookies with chopped dates and nuts are really delicious.   Sörur - these luscious cookies are originally a Danish pastry that was created in 1911 on the occasion of Sarah Bernhardt's visit to Denmark - but these cookies have now become an integral part of Icelandic cuisine!  Cinnamon stars are called “kanilkökur” in Icelandic. Oh yes, I love cinnamon!  [Translated from here.]

Although she was able to have between 60 and 90 rabbits from her farm slaughtered every month, the meat was served in top restaurants and sold in delicatessens, but unfortunately the sole proprietorship was ultimately not economically viable.

tomattonud-gulrotarmauksupa,Tomato and carrot soup – Tóm­attónuð gul­rót­armauksúpa,"Inexpensive food in Iceland - is that even possible? While searching for comparatively cheap meals, I came across this recipe for carrot and tomato soup, which was advertised as costing less than 2,000 ISK for four people combined. We then went shopping at Bónus - of course, I only needed half of the sour cream and only a few slices of the bacon and only a small part of the parsley. We still had salt for that and I didn't charge for the tap water either. Here are the prices: 1 can of tomatoes - 59 ISK 1 pack of parsley - 229 ISK 1 pack of breakfast bacon - 328 ISK 1 pack of carrots á 500 g - 398 ISK 1 pack of sour cream á 200 g - 198 ISK So we paid 1,212 ISK for the whole purchase, of which we ate for two people. If I take out the leftovers, I come to around 730 ISK for two people. According to the current conversion rate (as of mid-October 2017), I get €5.87 for a warm meal for two people. So - actually an inexpensive meal, even in Iceland!

blog-event-potatoes-in-icelandic-cuisine,"Blog event ""Potatoes in Icelandic cuisine""","Kartafla or jarðepli  In Icelandic, the potato is called ""kartafla"" (plural: ""kartöflur"") or ""jarðepli"" (= potato). The potato is a nightshade plant that originally comes from South America. There have been potatoes there for over 10,000 years. Since the 16th century, the potato has been spread from South America via the Canary Islands to Europe by Spanish conquerors. Since when have there been potatoes in Iceland? It is said that the district magistrate Gisli Magnússon (""Visi-Gisi"") tried to have potatoes exported to Iceland as seeds through his son as early as 1670 - as far as is known, but without success. The first potatoes in Iceland were probably harvested in Bessastaðir in 1758: Friðrik V, who reigned as Danish king from 1746 to 1766, sent Friedrich Wilhelm Hastfer (1722 - 1768) to Iceland in 1756. Hastfer was a Swedish baron of German descent, he had already made a name for himself in the field of sheep breeding and was therefore sent to Iceland by the Danish king to set up a sheep farm in Elliðaárdalur (presumably with Merino sheep imported from England). On Bessastaðir, today's official residence of the Icelandic president and the seat of the royal procurator in Iceland from the 13th to the 18th century, Hastfer had potatoes grown for the first time in Iceland; the first harvest took place in 1758. Unfortunately, nothing further is known about this potato cultivation.  Apparently potato cultivation and the import of seed potatoes was an important issue in Iceland at that time: Björn Halldórsson (1724 - 1794), who as a priest ran the rectory in the Sauðlauksdalur valley south of Patreksfjörður in the Icelandic Westfjords, is said to have had seeds delivered by ship in 1759 and was able to harvest potatoes for the first time in 1760. The potatoes that Björn Halldórsson grew were probably an old Swedish potato variety, now known as ""rauðar íslenskar"", or ""red Icelandic"". However, this variety is relatively susceptible to rot. Also in 1760, Guðlaugur Þorgeirsson began growing potatoes on the Álftanes peninsula, around the same time as Jón Bjarnason on Skarðströnd on the Hvammsfjörður and David Hansson on Barðaströnd in the southern Westfjords. In fact, it took around a century for the potato to slowly become established in Iceland.  The potato is an integral part of Icelandic cuisine Over the last 150 years, the potato has found its place in Icelandic cuisine.  The caramelized potatoes (""brúnaðar kartöflur"") are now the typical side dish for Icelandic meat dishes and potatoes in roux or white sauce (""kartöflur í jafningi"" and ""kartöfluupsstúfur"" are also a very popular side dish. Potato salad (""kartöflusalat"") is also warm and cold are quite common. Icelandic mashed potatoes (""kartöflumús"") have the special feature that they are seasoned with a little sugar. Potatoes also belong in classic fish dishes such as pounded fish (""plokkfiskur"") or cod balls (""þorskrúllur með hvítri sósu""), as well as in the almost ubiquitous Icelandic meat soup (""kjótsúpa""). And Icelandic potato bread (“kartöflubrauð”) is also extremely tasty.  As part of my blog event this week I would like to introduce you to three new, typically Icelandic potato dishes: Icelandic potato soup Potato cream cake Icelandic potato gratin  Have fun![Translated from here.]

kvoldmatur,Birthday dinner in Icelandic – Kvöldmatur,"It was my husband's birthday last week and we took it as a welcome opportunity to invite friends over for dinner over the weekend.  For obvious reasons, we invited people to Icelandic food and I thought about what I could offer that was “particularly typical”. However, the friends asked that it should be as ""harmless"" as possible - i.e. no singed sheep's heads, no ram's testicles and similar delicacies. This resulted in this “menu”:  As an appetizer ( lystauki ) there was plum vinegar - a small sip of mild vinegar (3% acid) mixed with warm water. There were also cookies with plum jam to “round off” the plum theme, so to speak. However, these are classic Icelandic Christmas cookies, the recipe for these ""hálfmánar"" (= half moons) is available at Christmas time! (But as a food blogger you have to start making Christmas recipes in good time.)  As a starter ( forréttur ) there was a fish soup, actually a humarsúpa, into which I added chopped cod for the last few minutes. Also very tasty! By the way, there was also freshly baked Sveitabrauð.  The main course ( aðalréttur ) was lamb goulash in a malt beer cream sauce. I added dried blueberries for a fruity note. The taste is wonderful - but the color is a bit purple!  Side dishes included caramelized potatoes and mashed turnips. When I mashed the beets, I (unfortunately) also used colored carrots, and the purple carrots really stood out in color. So it was a very purple-heavy meal! For dessert ( eftirréttur ) there was Westfjord-style Skyrterta - the dessert met with undivided enthusiasm from the guests, even those who were not entirely happy with fish, crabs, lamb and similar

However, no one could really answer me why this cake is called TV cake. Maybe because it's easy to eat without making a big mess while watching TV on the couch. But one theory also says that the cake is called TV cake because the surface of the cake looks like the TV picture in Iceland used to - crisp and noisy. Of course there could be something to that! In Iceland, the cake is not only known as Sjónvarpskaka (= television cake), but also as ""Skólakaka"" (= school cake) and as ""Gullkaka"" (= gold cake).

thurrkud-blaber,Dried blueberries – Þurrkuð bláber,"Berry picking in Iceland Dried blueberries And another article on the topic of “preserving food in Icelandic cuisine” that contains advertising: Food preservation is and has been an important theme in Icelandic cuisine, as Icelandic summers are short and winters are long and one has to survive the winter with the summer's harvest and the collected fruits. Preservation is and was also an important factor for imported foods. In Icelandic cuisine there are a lot of recipes with dried plums, dried apricots, dried dates - and also dried berries, such as blueberries here. By the way, dried blueberries are also supposed to be healthy - they are said to help against mild diarrhea and menstrual cramps, when consumed regularly they lower cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels and promote blood circulation and the decoction of dried blueberries is said to help against inflammation in the mouth and throat if you use it gargles. As already written, the company Pearl GmbH gave us one of their new Rosenstein & Söhne DH-25.k drying machine with 5 drying inserts *) as a permanent loan free of charge so that we could experiment with it. Here are my first attempts at drying blueberries: It is important to use fruits of the same size and, if possible, smaller ones - berries that were too big took forever for me, didn't dry properly even after 3 days and then (okay - given the heat here in June) they ended up in places in the jar started to mold. When dried, blueberries shrink to about 1/10 of their previous size. So for 50 g of dried blueberries you need around 500 g of fresh blueberries. Preparation Wash the blueberries briefly, if necessary with hot water, then dry them well and clean them of any damaged fruits and stem residues, etc.  Then place the fruits in the dehydrator and let them dry until they are completely dry and hard.     Then fill the dried berries into empty, dry jam jars and store them airtight.   *) - Amazon affiliate link[Translated from here.]

""Hlaup"" means ""run"", the word is used in various contexts, for example for ""jökulhlaup"" = ""glacial run"" (a glacial burst) or for brawn or jelly - everything that ""runs"". ""Sulta"" means ""jam"" or ""marmalade"", but Icelandic ""Rabarbarasulta"" is not only used as jam, but is also the classic Icelandic accompaniment to meat dishes - in terms of use, it is Icelandic, so to speak Ketchup.   Lamb, fries and rabarbarasulta I was recently asked about Icelandic recipes for rhubarb jam on Facebook - and realized that I actually didn't have a corresponding recipe in my blog, even though I've cooked different versions so many times. So I really wanted to make up for this omission - here are recipes for rhubarb jam, rhubarb jelly and ""Rabarbarasulta""!   Rabarbaramauk

thurrkadir-sveppir,Dried mushrooms – Þurrkaðir sveppir,"Hey, this is the first time that I'm allowed or have to write this: Warning, this post contains advertising!  The company Pearl GmbH gave us one of their new Rosenstein & Söhne DH-25.k dehydrator with 5 dehydrator inserts *) as a permanent loan free of charge so that we can experiment with it. Icelandic cuisine in particular revolves a lot around how food can be preserved. Not much fruit and vegetables really grow in Iceland, and the season is short. This made it all the more important to preserve what grows, what you collect and harvest, in order to be able to survive the long, inhospitable winter months in this country. The collected berries, the herbs, the seaweed - but also the mushrooms.  Þurrkaðir sveppir - dried mushrooms   One of the most beautiful gifts for me was a jar of dried mushrooms that Guðlaug Jónsdottir gave me when I visited her two years ago. Guðlaug Jónsdottir is the author, together with her husband, of ""West Fjords - A Culinary Journey"", one of my absolute favorite cookbooks about Icelandic cuisine. In your book you report on culinary traditions in the Westfjords. The experience of opening this jar of dried mushrooms and sticking your nose into it - indescribable! An absolute moment of happiness! And such a brilliant scent!!! The traditional way to dry mushrooms in Iceland is to string them on a string and then hang them to dry in a windy place that is preferably protected from moisture.  In Iceland there are traditionally certain ""huts"" with a very airy design, which are somewhat sheltered from the rain but perfectly windy and which are used to dry food.  I don't have such favorable weather conditions at home here in Germany; a similar experiment failed completely a while ago. I'm all the more pleased that I can now dry my mushrooms myself with the dehydrator. And then let off steam with corresponding mushroom recipes!

In the Westfjords, people tend to eat their skyrterta as a kind of dessert, unbaked and served in a large, shallow bowl or something similar - it only takes a few minutes to prepare the recipe, but it should then sit well for at least 24 hours before it tastes good it best!

all-about-ponnukokur,Pancakes as part of the Icelandic soul – All about Pönnukökur,"Panna and Kaka  The word ""panna"" (plural: ""pönnur"") means pan, the word ""kaka"" (plural: kökur"") means cake. Icelandic ""Pönnukökur"" are literally ""pancakes"". By the way, a single pancake is called ""Pönnukaka"". Incidentally, in terms of their structure, Icelandic pönnukökur are much more reminiscent of thin French crepes than of thick pancakes. What's special about Icelandic pancakes A special feature of Icelandic pancakes is that you add melted butter to the dough at the end, so you don't need any or only a little fat for the pan to bake and the pancakes are particularly delicious without dripping with fat. This way you can bake the Pönnukökur particularly thinly. Pönnukökupanna In Iceland there are even special pancake pans - I also have a cast iron ""pönnukökupanna"" that my husband gave me for Christmas three years ago at my very special request and that I love dearly and cherish. The pancakes turn out much better than in any other pan...  Pancakes as part of Icelandic identity - no celebration without pancakes  Icelandic pancakes are ""connected with our national identity"", I recently read from the Icelander Alda Sigmundsdóttir in her book ""The little book about the Icelanders in old times"" - and I found this sentence very apt. Alda writes that she doesn't know any Icelander who doesn't appreciate Pönnukökur - not only because the pancakes taste delicious (oh yes, they do!), they are also associated with the beautiful times in the lives of Icelanders: ""Icelandic pancakes are, above all,... baked when there is something to celebrate.""  Pönnukökur recipes  So there are few dishes that get to the core of what Icelandic cuisine and Icelandic identity are as much as pancakes. For this reason, my absolute favorite Pönnukökur recipe was chosen for the first recipe that we are allowed to present in the magazine “Zauber des Nordens"" (= ""Magic of the North"").  In addition to the classic Pönnukökur recipes, in which you sprinkle the Pönnukökur with sugar and cinnamon or spread it with jam or cream, roll it up and then serve it cold, there are of course many other variations, sweet and savory. On the occasion of our premiere at ""Zauber des Nordens"" I would like to introduce you to a few more unusual Pönnukökur recipes here in the blog this week: various sweet versions and also two hearty recipes. Just let yourself be surprised! [Translated from here.]

djupsteiktur-fiskur,Baked fish – Djúpsteiktur fiskur,"For this Icelandic ""fried fish"" recipe I used ""Þorskhnakkar"", i.e. ""cod snack"". By the way, in Iceland it is customary to eat the skin of fish, especially cod / halibut. After all, life in Iceland was so meager for centuries that people could not afford to throw anything edible away. Furthermore, the skin should be very rich in vitamins. In any case, it doesn't taste bad!

saetur-berjagljai-med-hangikjoti,Sweet berry shine with smoked lamb – Sætur berjagljái með hangikjöti,"Traditionally, crowberries (Krækiberja) are used for this recipe. Crowberries belong to the genus of heather plants, a flat plant where you have to look very closely - and then you suddenly discover a lot of berries. Crowberries contain twice as much vitamin C as blueberries and are therefore a very good source of vitamins. Strictly speaking, they also contain grayanotoxins - a plant poison, which is only contained in such small quantities in crowberries that there are no known cases of poisoning. In Iceland and other Scandinavian countries in particular, crowberries are traditionally used as food. If crowberries are not available at the moment, you can also use other types of berries or berry mixtures to make this berry sauce.   Hangikjöt with Flatbrauð Oh yes, the Hangikjöt - Hangikjöt is lamb meat smoked over sheep dung and aged for a long time, which gives the meat its very own and very special taste. Hangikjöt may not be exported to the EU; smoking with sheep dung is not permitted here. So here you have to make do with cold smoked lamb for this dish.

This recipe is less of a cake and more of a dessert - I would say: Icelandic Rhubarb Crumble. And I found it really delicious! Icelandic rye bread (""Rúgbrauð"") is a very special specialty that's hard to find in other countries. It's quite sweet and fluffy. For this recipe, I brought a portion of Rúgbrauð from Iceland to Germany!). Normally you either bake it yourself - or you replace the Rúgbrauð with pumpernickel. Pumpernickel is firmer and drier and has a slightly grainier structure, but the result is fine if baking yourself is not an option.

In recent years, however, there have been some small, very ambitious cheese producers in Iceland and you can increasingly find exciting Icelandic cheeses, such as the classic "" Gullosta "" (= ""Golden Cheese""), a type of Camembert, then different types of blue cheese, various Hard cheese...   Selection of specialties at Ostabúðin in Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík Incidentally, Icelandic cheeses are predominantly made from cow's milk. The special taste of the cheese is attributed to the fact that Icelandic cows are fed almost exclusively on grass.   Cow over Akureyri A relatively common spread was also...  ... cabbage roe butter.   Berjahlaup Jam, such as blueberry jam, berry jelly ( berjahlaup ) or various tomato jams, is usually eaten in Iceland on a piece of buttered bread with a slice of cheese on top.

Jóhannesson had recently visited the Menntaskólinn in Akureyri when asked by a student whether he liked to eat ""Pizza Hawaii"" and replied that he was fundamentally against pineapple and other fruit on pizza, if he could, he would have that banned. A heated discussion ensued - about pizza toppings. And the president corrected on Facebook: He thinks pineapple is good - just not on pizza. He is also pleased that as Icelandic president he does not have the power to legally ban pineapple on pizza. And - he wouldn't want to live in a country where the president has absolute power.  Oh, but he still recommends pizza with seafood: ""Ég mæli með fiskmeti á pítsu."" By the way, the American soldiers brought pizza to Iceland...

laugardagssnudarnir,Saturday rolls – Laugardagssnúðarnir,"Source: timarit.is Saturday rolls This recipe originally comes from an Icelandic newspaper from February 1960. “Saturday” means “Laugardagur” in Icelandic, literally “washing day”. Traditionally, washing was done on Saturday, both the laundry and the people themselves. Since the housewives were busy doing laundry that day, the newspaper recommended that they quickly bake these quick, very filling rolls on Saturday morning and serve them to the family before their mother went to do the laundry and didn't have time to cook for lunch. And if she were lucky, there might be one last rolls left for the housewife on Sunday... well then - meal!

The event runs until February 18, 2017. I find the topic really exciting... so I picked out one of my first recipes and ""remodeled"" the whole thing a bit and re-photographed it. The classic Skúffukaka is THE typical Icelandic chocolate sheet cake that can be found almost everywhere in a wide variety of variations. For a change, I decided on a smaller recipe, with coconut flakes on the chocolate icing and, so to speak, to ""emphasize"" the coconut note, also with coconut flour. And with Skyr.

skonsuterta-i,Skonsur cake (savoury) – Skonsuterta (I),"Skonsur are, in a sense, “pancakes in Icelandic”. Small, thick pancakes in contrast to the larger, wafer-thin ""Pönnukökur"". The skonsur is often eaten ""as is"", sprinkled with sugar, cinnamon or powdered sugar to taste and/or with jam. If you want something a little more festive, layer the Skonsur with the appropriate filling (sweet or savory) to make a Skonsur cake. These are very popular at Icelandic (cake) buffets, especially in the run-up to Christmas, but also throughout the rest of the year. One more note: No, you can't actually make this skonsur fresh for breakfast, because it takes quite a long time to fry all the skonsur in a pancake pan at low heat. I think it took me about two hours. But if you were to bake at a higher heat, the outside would probably be burned before the dough on the inside was cooked through. So the only thing left to do is start early, ideally prepare the day before!

This year we had homemade liver sausage based on an Icelandic recipe for Þorrablót!

ponnusteikt-hjortu,Fried hearts – Pönnusteikt hjörtu,"Is it really heartless to eat hearts? There is now the “nose to tail” movement, ie the conscious effort to eat an animal completely again, from nose to tail. This is intended to express respect for the animal: If you kill and slaughter an animal in order to eat it, you should at least use the whole animal completely. In addition, the traditional dishes that have slowly disappeared from menus also have their taste appeal and sometimes offer a special dimension that we are often no longer used to today. In a country as barren as Iceland, everything that could be used was traditionally used, which is why classic Icelandic cuisine has many corresponding dishes with liver, hearts, heads, feet, testicles, etc.  In Iceland, this dish is usually prepared with lamb hearts. On average, a lamb heart weighs around 150g, for this dish you should expect 300 g of heart per person. For 4 people you need approx. 1 kg of hearts. I find it quite difficult to get lamb hearts in normal grocery stores or butchers here in Germany, but you can also make do with other hearts.

I struggled with the ""translation"" of this dish to make it reproducible outside of Iceland. There is no salt meat available in Germany and probably in other countries, either. Salt meat is fresh meat that has been marinated in brine - and it really tastes incredibly salty. My recommendation is to make do with cured pork tenderloin. However, this is not fresh, but slightly smoked - so it's not quite the same and tastes much less salty. Alternatively, you can also pickle your own Saltkjöt (see recipe ).

lettsteiktur-lundi,Seared puffin – Léttsteiktur lundi,"In Iceland there are also things on the menu that tend to cause horror in our part of the world. In addition to whale meat and dishes such as sheep's head or cod head, this also includes puffin ("" lundi ""). You can still often find puffins on Icelandic menus today.   Latrabjarg The cute-looking little animals that breed in burrows on cliffs in the summer can be found in Iceland, for example, on the Látrabjarg cliffs (in the far west of the Westfjords), at Reynisfjall near Vík í Mýrdal on the south coast of Iceland or on the Westman Islands. Around the middle of May, the birds lay their eggs in holes/burrows they have dug themselves, and the young hatch after just under 6 weeks. After another 6 to 7 weeks the young birds fledge. From the end of August onwards, it is very rare to see puffins on the bird cliffs in Iceland. The animals only return in April.   View from Dyrhólaey to Reynisfjara  In Iceland, puffins were often an important source of food, especially at the end of spring when supplies from the previous year were exhausted. Then people collected the eggs from the nests on the cliffs or caught the adult birds.  The IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, has classified the puffin as an endangered species since 2015 after populations have declined significantly in recent decades. When we saw frozen puffins in the meat department at the Kolaportið, the market / flea market that takes place every weekend in Tollhúsið on Tryggvagata in Reykjavík, I wanted to take a bird with me and try it... if you're serious about Icelandic cuisine , I think that's part of it too. By the way, the meat is visually more reminiscent of beef, it smells a lot like fish and tastes almost like liver.

When I saw that on the Finnish food & design blog MAHTAVA! Currently the blog parade "" This is what the north tastes like! "" is running, it was immediately clear to me - I wanted to take part in it, with exactly this recipe for ""Hardcore Apple Crumble in Icelandic"". Because it contains so much of what characterizes Icelandic pastries for me - cakes with vanilla pudding and lots of cinnamon!

""Skyr with honey"" in particular sounded interesting, even if I only know it from a few breakfast recipes in Iceland - more from the whole food corner, where I also like to go. I then decided on an alternative version of ""Love Balls"", without vanilla, but with honey skyr. I changed the ratio of flour to skyr a bit because the consistency of the dough otherwise didn't fit properly. Classic Ástarpungar (""love balls"" or ""love balls"") are prepared with regular skyr. In the supermarket, these “loveballs” are often advertised as a typical Icelandic specialty - which of course they are!

hvonn-med-bladlauk,Angelica with leeks – Hvönn með blaðlauk,"When used correctly, angelica is fundamentally healthy due to the tannins and vitamins it contains. It has a mild antibacterial effect and can be used for sore throats or urinary tract infections; some people even swear by it for athlete's foot. It is also said to help against depressive moods and burnout. Angelica also stimulates digestion - but in large quantities it also stimulates the uterus and can lead to bleeding. Therefore, pregnant women should not consume angelica in large quantities, but rather only eat it as a spice so as not to cause bleeding. By the way, you should definitely wear gloves when harvesting angelica, as many people react to the fresh plant sap with allergic skin irritations.  Fresh angelica stems and fresh leeks are used for this dish. If you don't have fresh angelica on hand, you can alternatively use celery, which is very close to angelica both in terms of appearance and taste.

steiktur-steinbitur-med-brun-sosa,Fried wolffish with brown sauce – Steiktur steinbítur með brún sósa,"The fish, which is called ""steinbítur"" in Iceland, is often sold here as ""steinbiter"", but it is actually sea wolf. The fish grow to a height of over one meter and weigh around 20 to 25 kilograms when fully grown. Admittedly, visually they take some getting used to with their very wide mouth and strong teeth, which have enormous power and can be seriously dangerous to fishermen and anglers and their fingers, even for a long time after they have been caught. The wolffish is caught all along Iceland's coasts, but is particularly common in the Westfjords. In April, a separate trip was often made here just to catch wolffish (while otherwise the fish are often just bycatch), and the fish caught were then divided between boat owners and the ship's crew according to very specific rules. The yield from this trip could be quite generous and ensure the survival of the families for a long time. In the Westfjords, the wolffish is traditionally breaded in flour, fried and then baked in the oven with a thick brown sauce and onions.

the-taste-of-nature-blueberry-pie,The Taste of Nature - Blueberry Pie,"Here is one of the recipes from my beloved Westfjords cookbook ""West Fjords - A Culinary Journey."" by Guðlaug Jónsdóttir and Karl Kristján Ásgeirsson - thank you again, Guðlaug, for allowing me to present this recipe from your book here!!!   Velkomin á Bláberjadaga í Súðavík! Welcome to International Blueberry Festival in Súðavík!  The small fishing town of Sú ðavik (around 200 inhabitants) is located one fjord further around 20 km from Ísa fjörður and is in the middle of an absolute berry region. At the end of August, the ""Bláberjadaga"", the ""International Blueberry Festival"", takes place in this place. The festival features competitions in berry picking, blueberry pie eating and blueberry runs over various distances, as well as music events - always a big event for young and old! Sú ðavik gained notoriety through an avalanche accident in the snowy winter of 1994/1995. Snow avalanches occur frequently in the area. A large avalanche on January 16, 1995 destroyed around 1/3 of the town and 14 residents were killed in the accident. The old location has been in an official danger zone ever since. The residents have built new houses towards the fjord and have essentially “moved” their location a little bit. The old houses, which can only be used in summer, now serve as summer houses.   polar fox Deep sea fishing is mainly offered in Sú ðavik and the Melrakkasetur Íslands , the Icelandic Arctic Fox Center, is also located in Sú ðavik. Recipe: Dagbjört's Blueberry Pie At the Blueberry Days 2011, Dagbjört Hjaltadóttir won the competition for the tastiest blueberry dish, the recipe was published in the Westfjords cookbook with the consent of the winner and the organizers.

blog-event-hnodmor,"Kneaded fat – Blog event ""Hnoðmör""","Kneaded fat (""hnoðmör"" or also called ""mörflot"") is a typical Icelandic specialty that originally comes from the Westfjords, but has now spread throughout Iceland. The fat is separated from the stomach of the freshly slaughtered sheep as intact as possible and then processed further. Traditionally, melted kneaded fat is served on December 23rd with the ""Þorláksmessa"" as a side dish to the ""Gammelray"" ( kæst skata ), but knead fat is also used in traditional dishes from the Westfjords such as pounded fish (here in Germany you can use the knead fat at the pounding fish). Help fish with lard). In the Westfjords, a St. Andrew's Cross used to be carved into one side of the finished pieces of plasticine - it was probably a religious-magical custom, a kind of ""protective symbol"" against evil spirits. The older people probably still say today that this was to prevent the devil from getting into the dough...   Saga Museum, Reykjavik So, now I'm starting my blog event - I'm trying to make my own kneaded fat. But I still have no idea whether it will work! I received the following instructions in Iceland from an experienced cook from the Westfjords: The fat is kneaded and formed into ""dumplings"", which are then left to firm up a little overnight. The next day, the dumplings are individually wrapped in pieces of linen or gauze and hung on the terrace or somewhere as windy as possible but at the same time somewhat protected from the rain. The whole thing is left hanging in the cloth bags for 6 to 8 weeks until the fat has turned blue-green and hairy. (If it's too cold outside and the fat doesn't get furry enough, it's best to bring it back into the kitchen for 2-3 days to let it ""ripen"".) The blue-green, furry-hairy fat is then chopped up, kneaded well and formed into cubes of about half a pound and then stored in a cool place. So I start my attempt: Sunday, October 11th I knead my fat, shape it into dumplings,...  ... wrap them in thin fabric...  ...and tie the pieces of fabric.  Now the three bags are hanging on our terrace in as windy a place as possible, but at the same time somewhat protected from the rain.  To be continued - one way or another! :-) Update after 48 hours... The bags have now been hanging for about 48 hours - but nothing noticeable has happened yet!  Update after 3 weeks... For Halloween, after about 3 weeks, an update from my three little ghosts - but nothing dramatic has happened yet, there are no blue hairs growing out of the fat bags yet...  Here's another detailed photo from broad daylight...  I then stopped the experiment - even after 6 weeks, my fat didn't grow any hair nor did anything turn greenish-blue, unfortunately it didn't work. Probably not cold enough and the fat is already too sterile... try again later![Translated from here.]

With moss bread, however, the appetite-increasing effect is more likely achieved through the delicious taste.

In Norwegian this cheese is called ""mysost"", in Swedish ""mesost"" - in Icelandic the solid whey cheese that is cut with a cheese slicer is called ""mysuostur"". There is also “mysingur”, a popular spread. With ""mysingur"" the whey isn't cooked off quite as much and the cheese has roughly the color and consistency of peanut butter - but it smells and tastes very different, very intense and spicy! The whey cheese soup can be cooked with both solid and soft Icelandic whey cheese, but with solid cheese you should increase the water content by 50% - otherwise the soup will be correspondingly thick, but it also tastes great!

sorur,Sörur,"These cookies or confectionery are originally a Danish invention in honor of the French actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844 - 1923). The crowds cheered her on her first visit to Copenhagen in 1880. When she visited Denmark again in 1911 to present her biography, one of Copenhagen's leading patisseries is said to have created this pastry in her honor. In Danish this pastry is called ""Sarah Bernhardt Kager"", in Sweden it is called ""biskvier"" - and in Iceland it has become extremely popular under the name ""Sörur"". Incidentally, many families have developed their own Sörur recipe, so that there are numerous variations of this pastry today.

bananabraud,Banana bread – Bananabrauð,"Banana plants in the greenhouse in Hveragerði No, of course banana bread is not a ""classic Icelandic"" food, but over 50 years ago a former US soldier who was stationed in Iceland during World War II and fell in love with an Icelandic woman brought the first banana plant as a gift brought to the country, bananas have spread sustainably there, especially in the greenhouses of Hveragerði and the surrounding area, which are heated with geothermal energy. Icelandic bananas are particularly popular today, especially because they can ripen directly on the palm trees and not in boxes like the imported bananas from Central and South America. The recipe for banana bread probably came to Iceland with the US soldiers - but it quickly became native there and can now be found in almost every Icelandic recipe collection. PS: We had visitors over the weekend (May 2019), so I took the opportunity to revise the photos of the old recipe here from 2014 and post new pictures!

svid,Svið,"Svið is a classic Icelandic meat dish. Since there wasn't much land, everything that could be used was used - and when a sheep was slaughtered, EVERYTHING was of course ""roasted"", including the ram's testicles and the head. Svið, i.e. the singed half sheep's heads, are still offered frozen in supermarkets today, but we had to search a bit. In Reykjavík we didn't find any Svið in the freezer counters, but we were successful in the more rural Hveragerði. The thawed sheep's head is boiled in a pot with plenty of salted water for about 1.5 hours; the resulting foam is skimmed off regularly. However, I had to be careful not to accidentally scoop up the eye, as it had come loose and kept popping up into the foam while cooking. Also important – always ventilate plenty when cooking, as the preparation is relatively “smell-intensive”. After cooking, take the head out of the cooking pot, let it cool on a plate - and then try it. Personally, I have found that even if it is Icelandic, Svið is still not for me! The taste was pleasantly “harmless,” and once you peeled the skin off the head and tongue, it was actually just regular, nice sheep meat. However, the “cheeks” were quite greasy. For me, the meal later ended up in the toilet; I chalked it up to “emotional vomiting”. Therefore - be careful, the film is definitely ""disgusting""!  [Translated from here.]

blaberjabaka,Blueberry pastry – Bláberjabaka,"Bláberjabaka, or “blueberry pastry”, actually a kind of frozen blueberry cake, is an extremely delicious dessert!

lax-i-blaberjasosa,Salmon in blueberry marinade – Lax í bláberjasósa,"Well, the combination of fish with blueberries and a large load of onions and garlic seems quite unusual at first glance - but young Icelandic cuisine likes to try out unusual things and put traditional local products together in a new taste context. Blueberries, bláberja, are a popular, typically Icelandic product that can be found almost everywhere on the island's heathland - so it can happen that in the local museum the nice museum guard unexpectedly offers you a bowl of delicious fresh blueberries, which she had collected in the morning on the way to work. And there are also plenty of salmon rivers (“laxá”) and the associated salmon river valleys (“laxárdalur”) in Iceland - with correspondingly many salmon, of course.

kanilsnudar,Cinnamon rolls – Kanilsnúðar,"Cinnamon rolls are apparently a typically northern European specialty; you can find them as “kanilsnúðar” in Iceland, as “kanelsneklen” in Norway or as “kanelbullar” in Sweden (or at Ikea). In Sweden, Kanelbullens dag , “Cinnamon Roll Day”, has been celebrated every year on October 4th since 1999 - probably to the delight of the local baking industry.  It is said that in Iceland it used to be common practice when inviting people to a coffee party that the visitor was allowed to eat at least one of the quite filling cinnamon rolls before helping themselves to the delicious cakes or other pastries.  Here is a recipe version for the “kanilsnúðar”, which is very popular with my children and is generally also suitable for people with lactose intolerance:

gulrotarkaka,Icelandic carrot cake – Gulrótarkaka,"with or without cream cheese coating   This Gulrótarkaka has become established in our family and I feel like I bake it at least once a month, often at the special request of my daughter. Nowadays I like to vary it, sometimes I bake the dough in two springform pans (baking time then approx. 30 - 40 minutes), make twice the amount of cream (i.e. 300 mascarpone, 400 g cream cheese, etc.) and then put the whole thing like this in the photo in the style of a ""naked cake"".
